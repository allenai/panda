Response: 2 + 2 = 4

This is a basic arithmetic fact. When you combine 2 units with another 2 units, you get a total of 4 units.

Step complete.

-------------------------------------
Final summary: All three LLMs tested (GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Llama 3.1) correctly answered that 2 + 2 = 4 and provided nearly identical explanations describing it as a basic arithmetic fact. There were no differences in accuracy or substantial differences in their responses to this simple mathematical question.
