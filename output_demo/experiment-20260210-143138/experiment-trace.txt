Strategizing...
Planning...
Plan:
   1. Generate a dataset of 5 two-digit addition problems with their correct answers
   2. Query Claude with each addition problem and collect its responses
   3. Evaluate Claude's responses by comparing them to the correct answers and calculate accuracy
   4. Display the results showing each problem, Claude's answer, correct answer, and overall accuracy statistics
   5. Write a report summarizing the findings
