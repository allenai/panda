1,"Topic: To what extent to LMs have a 'theory of mind'?
Task: Assess the ability of language models to predict human beliefs and intentions in complex scenarios
Rationale: The papers suggest that while language models (LMs) can mimic certain aspects of human-like reasoning, it remains unclear to what extent they truly understand the beliefs and intentions behind human actions. This raises the question of whether LMs can effectively model a 'theory of mind'—the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others. The proposed task aims to explore this by testing LMs on their ability to predict human beliefs and intentions in scenarios where these are not explicitly stated but must be inferred from context."
2,"Topic: To what extent to LMs have a 'theory of mind'?
Task: Evaluate language models' ability to understand and generate explanations for unexpected human behavior
Rationale: The papers imply that understanding a 'theory of mind' involves not only predicting behavior but also rationalizing deviations from expected behavior. This task will test whether LMs can comprehend situations where humans act against apparent self-interest or societal norms and provide coherent explanations for such actions, which requires a nuanced understanding of human psychology and social context."
3,"Topic: To what extent to LMs have a 'theory of mind'?
Task: Investigate language models' capacity to attribute false beliefs in narrative contexts
Rationale: A key component of 'theory of mind' is the ability to understand that others can hold beliefs that are different from one's own and may be false. This task will probe LMs for their ability to track characters' beliefs within stories, especially when those beliefs are incorrect, and predict how those false beliefs might influence future actions."
4,"Topic: To what extent to LMs have a 'theory of mind'?
Task: Analyze language models' proficiency in distinguishing between literal and non-literal language as an indicator of 'theory of mind'
Rationale: A sophisticated 'theory of mind' includes the ability to discern when language is being used figuratively or sarcastically, which often relies on understanding the speaker's intent and the context. This task will focus on evaluating LMs' abilities to differentiate between literal and non-literal uses of language, a skill that is closely related to inferring mental states."
5,"Topic: To what extent to LMs have a 'theory of mind'?

This task aims to explore whether LMs exhibit similar error patterns to humans when faced with logical reasoning problems that require multi-step inference, common sense, or understanding of context. By analyzing these error patterns, we can gain insights into the limitations of current LMs and how they process information differently from humans."
37,"Topic: Do LMs exhibit the same failure modes as humans?
Task: Investigate the susceptibility of LMs and humans to semantic illusions in sentence comprehension.
Rationale: Previous research has shown that humans can be susceptible to semantic illusions, where they fail to notice inconsistencies within a sentence due to skimming or assumptions based on prior knowledge. This task will explore whether LMs, like humans, are prone to similar semantic illusions when processing sentences. By comparing the performance of LMs and documented human performance on semantically illusory sentences, we can better understand the cognitive processes of LMs and their alignment with human cognition."
38,"Topic: Do LMs exhibit the same failure modes as humans?
Task: Analyze the response patterns of LMs and humans to ambiguous language in humor.
Rationale: Ambiguity in language is a common source of humor, and humans often rely on contextual cues and world knowledge to interpret such ambiguity. This task will examine how LMs handle linguistic ambiguities that are intentionally used in jokes or humorous sentences, compared to documented human reactions. The goal is to determine if LMs can identify and resolve ambiguities in a way that aligns with human understanding, particularly when the ambiguity is the source of humor."
39,"Topic: Do LMs exhibit the same failure modes as humans?
Task: Examine the effect of cognitive load on error rates in LMs compared to humans during multitasking.
Rationale: Humans often make more errors when they are required to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, especially if these tasks are cognitively demanding. This task aims to explore whether increasing the cognitive load (by combining multiple tasks) affects LMs in a similar way. By simulating a multitasking environment for LMs and comparing their performance with human data under increased cognitive load, we can assess whether LMs exhibit similar degradation in performance."
40,"Topic: Do LMs exhibit the same failure modes as humans?
Task: Investigate the impact of priming on LMs and humans in decision-making tasks.

The proposed task aims to investigate this by assessing the responses of LMs to morally charged scenarios that are presented within different cultural frameworks."
42,"Topic: How well are LMs able to make moral judgements?
Task: Evaluate the influence of phrasing on LMs' moral judgements
Rationale: Previous research may have assessed LMs' ability to make moral judgements, but an open question remains: how does the phrasing of a situation affect an LM's moral judgement? This task will explore whether different ways of describing the same ethical dilemma lead to different responses from an LM. By systematically varying the language used to describe moral scenarios, we can investigate the robustness and potential biases in LMs' ethical reasoning."
43,"Topic: How well are LMs able to make moral judgements?
Task: Analyze the impact of context length on LMs' moral judgements
Rationale: Prior studies may have evaluated LMs' moral judgement capabilities, but the impact of context length on these judgements has not been thoroughly explored. This task will investigate how the amount of background information provided affects an LM's ability to make moral judgements. By presenting ethical scenarios with varying lengths of context, we can assess whether LMs require extensive background information to make accurate moral decisions or if they can do so with minimal context."
44,"Topic: How well are LMs able to make moral judgements?
Task: Investigate the ability of LMs to predict societal reactions to moral decisions
Rationale: While previous research may have focused on the direct moral judgements made by LMs, an unexplored area is their ability to anticipate the societal consequences of these judgements. This task will examine whether LMs can accurately predict how different groups within society might react to a given moral decision. By doing so, we can assess the LM's understanding of social dynamics and public opinion related to ethical issues."
45,"Topic: How well are LMs able to make moral judgements?
Task: Determine the effect of moral frameworks on LMs' ethical reasoning
Rationale: Previous research has likely examined LMs' ability to make moral judgements, but it may not have considered how different established moral frameworks influence these judgements. This task will explore whether LMs can apply various ethical theories—such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics—to specific scenarios and how these frameworks affect their decisions."
