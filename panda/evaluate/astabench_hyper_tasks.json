The hybrid annotation paradigm integrates descriptive and prescriptive elements, allowing annotators to use personal judgment while adhering to specific criteria. This method captures the subtleties of implicit hate speech while maintaining annotation consistency. Hierarchical entity expansion enhances the model's ability to recognize nuanced expressions of hate speech related to specific identity groups by expanding the range of entities the model can recognize. The hypothesis posits that this combination will improve both the F1 score and robustness of models across diverse datasets. The study will involve training models using the hybrid annotation paradigm, with and without hierarchical entity expansion, and evaluating their performance on datasets like the XtremeSpeech corpus and the Gab Hate Corpus. This approach addresses gaps in existing research by exploring the synergistic effects of combining these two techniques, which have not been extensively tested together. The expected outcome is that models using the combined approach will demonstrate higher accuracy and generalizability, providing a more effective solution for implicit hate speech detection. \nKey Variables:\nHybrid Annotation Paradigm: This variable represents the integration of descriptive and prescriptive annotation elements. Annotators are encouraged to use personal judgment while adhering to specific criteria for labeling hate speech. This approach aims to balance subjective interpretation with consistency, capturing the nuances of implicit hate speech. The hybrid annotation paradigm will be implemented by training annotators to first consider their personal reactions to a post and then cross-reference their judgment with provided guidelines. Its effectiveness will be assessed by evaluating the diversity and consistency of annotations, as well as model performance.\nHierarchical Entity Expansion: This variable involves expanding entities in a hierarchical manner to improve the recognition of language sensitive to specific identity groups in hate speech datasets. The implementation includes using hierarchical entity expansion within hybrid models to capture nuanced expressions of hate speech related to gender and sexual orientation identities. This method is evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalizability across different datasets. The hierarchical entity expansion is expected to enhance the model's ability to capture implicit hate speech, leading to improved recall and F1 score.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system. First, a hybrid annotation paradigm will be established by combining descriptive and prescriptive elements. Annotators will be trained to apply subjective judgment and adhere to specific guidelines. The implementation will involve creating a dataset annotated using this hybrid approach. Next, hierarchical entity expansion will be integrated into the model training process. This will involve expanding entities in a hierarchical manner to capture nuanced expressions of hate speech. The model will be trained using the annotated dataset, with and without hierarchical entity expansion, to compare the effects. The implementation will use existing codeblocks for annotation and model training, while new logic for hierarchical entity expansion will be built. Data will flow from the annotation phase to model training, with outputs being evaluated for F1 score and robustness across diverse datasets. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the F1 score, which balances precision and recall. The robustness of the models will be assessed through cross-dataset evaluation, testing the models on datasets not used during training, such as the XtremeSpeech corpus and the Gab Hate Corpus. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher F1 score and consistent performance across datasets, indicating better generalizability. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and qualitative assessments will be derived from the diversity and consistency of annotations.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to evaluate whether incorporating hierarchical entity expansion into a hybrid annotation paradigm improves implicit hate speech detection.

Results file containing:\n   - F1 scores, precision, recall for both conditions\n   - Bootstrap comparison results\n   - Cross-dataset performance metrics\n2. Detailed logs of the annotation process\n3. Examples of expanded entities for manual inspection\n\nPlease run the MINI_PILOT first. If successful, proceed to PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT for human verification. Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls as specified in the conditioning instructions. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

CARMO dynamically generates context-relevant criteria, such as coherence scores, to evaluate the logical flow and structure of dialogue outputs. This approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to create criteria that adapt to user queries, ensuring that the generated dialogues maintain a logical and coherent narrative. By focusing on coherence, the reward model can mitigate issues like reward hacking, where models optimize for superficial features rather than genuine quality. The hypothesis posits that CARMO with coherence scores will outperform static reward models in aligning dialogue generation with human preferences. This research addresses gaps in existing literature by exploring the dynamic adaptation of reward criteria in dialogue tasks, which has not been extensively tested. The expected outcome is an improved alignment with human preferences, leading to more engaging and contextually appropriate dialogues. \nKey Variables:\nContext-Aware Reward Modeling (CARMO): CARMO involves generating dynamic, context-relevant criteria to ground the reward model before producing reward scores. In this research, CARMO will be implemented to dynamically generate coherence scores as a measure of logical consistency in dialogue generation tasks. The coherence score evaluates the logical flow and structure of dialogues, ensuring that each part of the conversation follows logically from the previous one. This approach is selected for its ability to adapt to different contexts and mitigate reward hacking by focusing on genuine quality. The expected role of CARMO is to enhance the alignment of dialogue outputs with human preferences by ensuring logical consistency, which is crucial for maintaining user engagement and satisfaction.\nCoherence Score: Coherence scores are used to measure the logical consistency of dialogue outputs by evaluating how well the generated content maintains a logical flow and structure. In the context of CARMO, coherence scores are dynamically generated by the reward model, which adapts to the context of the user query. This involves leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create criteria that assess the logical flow of the dialogue, ensuring that the output remains sensible and rational. The coherence score is computed by analyzing the transition between dialogue turns, checking for logical connections and consistency in the narrative. This metric is crucial for dialogue generation tasks, where maintaining a coherent conversation is essential for user engagement.\nDialogue Generation Tasks: Dialogue generation tasks require the model to produce conversational responses that are contextually appropriate and engaging. In this research, dialogue generation will be evaluated using CARMO with coherence scores to assess the logical consistency of the generated dialogues. The task involves generating dialogues that align with human preferences, focusing on maintaining a coherent and logical narrative. The expected outcome is that dialogues generated using CARMO with coherence scores will achieve higher alignment with human preferences compared to those generated using static reward models.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for dialogue generation and reward modeling. The implementation will involve the following steps: 1. Use an existing dialogue generation codeblock to produce conversational outputs based on user queries. 2. Implement the CARMO framework to dynamically generate coherence scores as a measure of logical consistency. This will involve using large language models to create context-relevant criteria for evaluating dialogue coherence. 3. Integrate the coherence score evaluation into the reward model, allowing it to adaptively assess the logical flow of dialogues. 4. Compare the performance of CARMO with coherence scores against a static reward model that does not adapt to context changes. 5. Evaluate the alignment of dialogue outputs with human preferences using preference scores and user satisfaction ratings. The implementation will require building new components for dynamic coherence score generation and integration with the reward model, while reusing existing dialogue generation codeblocks. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be preference scores, which measure the alignment of dialogue outputs with human preferences. These scores will be generated by a reward model trained on binary preference data, where human annotators compare pairs of dialogue completions and indicate their preference. The secondary metric will be user satisfaction ratings, collected through surveys or direct interaction with users, where they rate their satisfaction with the generated dialogues on a scale. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the preference scores and user satisfaction ratings of dialogues generated using CARMO with coherence scores against those generated using static reward models. Improvement will be interpreted as higher preference scores and user satisfaction ratings for dialogues generated with CARMO, indicating better alignment with human preferences.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing a Context-Aware Reward Modeling (CARMO) approach against a static reward model baseline for dialogue generation. The experiment should have three possible settings controlled by PILOT_MODE (str): 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'.\n\nCore Components:\n1. Dialogue Generation: Use gpt-4o-mini to generate dialogue responses to a set of prompts.\n2. Static Reward Model (Baseline): Use gpt-4o-mini to evaluate dialogue coherence using a fixed template: 'Rate the logical consistency and coherence of this dialogue on a scale of 0-1, where 0 is completely incoherent and 1 is perfectly coherent. Dialogue: [dialogue]'\n3. CARMO Reward Model (Experimental): Use gpt-4o-mini to first generate context-specific coherence criteria based on the dialogue context, then evaluate using those criteria. Two-step process:\n   Step 1: 'Given this dialogue context, generate 3 specific criteria for evaluating logical consistency and coherence: [context]'\n   Step 2: 'Rate the logical consistency and coherence of this dialogue on a scale of 0-1, using these specific criteria: [criteria]. Dialogue: [dialogue]'\n\nPilot Parameters:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 5 different dialogue contexts, generate 2 responses per context (total 10 dialogues). Each dialogue should be 2-3 turns. Evaluate each using both baseline and CARMO approaches.\n- PILOT: Use 20 different dialogue contexts, generate 3 responses per context (total 60 dialogues). Each dialogue should be 3-4 turns.\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use 100 different dialogue contexts, generate 5 responses per context (total 500 dialogues). Each dialogue should be 4-6 turns.\n\nDialogue Contexts:\nUse simple scenarios that require logical consistency, such as:\n- Planning a vacation\n- Ordering at a restaurant\n- Discussing a movie\n- Making weekend plans\n- Giving directions\n\nData Collection:\n1. For each dialogue:\n   - Store the context\n   - Store the generated dialogue\n   - Store the baseline reward score\n   - Store the CARMO criteria generated\n   - Store the CARMO reward score\n\nEvaluation:\n1. Calculate mean and standard deviation of reward scores for both conditions\n2. Use bootstrap resampling to test for significant differences between conditions\n3. Generate plots showing the distribution of scores for both conditions\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. Save all dialogues, scores, and criteria to a JSON file\n2. Generate a PDF report containing:\n   - Summary statistics\n   - Bootstrap test results\n   - Score distribution plots\n   - Example dialogues with highest and lowest coherence scores from each condition\n\nImplementation Notes:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT mode\n3. Stop after PILOT mode - do not proceed to FULL_EXPERIMENT (this requires manual verification)\n4. Use try-except blocks and appropriate logging throughout\n5. Implement appropriate random seeds for reproducibility\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n1. All dialogues are generated successfully\n2. Both reward models (baseline and CARMO) provide scores for all dialogues\n3. Statistical analysis completes without errors\n4. PDF report is generated with all required components \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

SCD leverages the Contact Hypothesis from social psychology to mitigate bias by simulating social interactions through prompts, which are then used to instruction-tune language models with unbiased responses. The BOLD benchmark evaluates language models for bias across various scenarios, providing a structured way to quantify bias across different dimensions. By combining SCD with the BOLD benchmark, this study aims to improve the fairness of language model outputs while ensuring that safety is not compromised. Safety classifiers will be employed to detect offensive or harmful content, ensuring that the debiasing process does not introduce new risks. This approach addresses gaps in existing research by focusing on the synergy between debiasing techniques and comprehensive bias evaluation, offering a novel method to enhance language model equity in a safe manner. \nKey Variables:\nSocial Contact Debiasing (SCD): SCD uses the Contact Hypothesis to simulate social interactions through prompts, instruction-tuning models with unbiased responses. This method is implemented by creating a dataset that measures various types of social bias across different models. SCD is selected for its effectiveness in reducing biases in models like LLaMA 2, achieving significant bias reduction after minimal tuning. It directly influences the equity of language model outputs by reducing biases related to social contact scenarios.\nBOLD Benchmark: The BOLD benchmark evaluates language models for bias across various scenarios, focusing on fairness and impartiality by analyzing generated text for signs of bias related to gender, race, and other social categories. It involves tasks where the model generates text based on prompts, and the outputs are evaluated for bias using predefined metrics. The BOLD benchmark is chosen for its structured approach to quantifying bias across different dimensions, providing a reliable measure of language model equity.\nSafety Classifiers: Safety classifiers are trained to detect offensive or harmful content in language model outputs, providing real-time feedback on the safety of generated content. They evaluate outputs for harmful language, with safety scores indicating the proportion of outputs deemed safe. Safety classifiers are integrated into the language model pipeline to ensure that the debiasing process does not introduce new risks, maintaining the safety of the outputs.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks and building new components where necessary. The Social Contact Debiasing (SCD) technique will be implemented by creating a dataset of social interaction prompts and instruction-tuning the language model with unbiased responses. This process will be facilitated by existing codeblocks for data generation and model tuning. The BOLD benchmark will be used to evaluate the equity of the language model outputs, with tasks designed to probe for bias across various scenarios. Existing codeblocks for bias evaluation will be utilized to run the language model on BOLD tasks and score the outputs against established bias metrics. Safety classifiers will be integrated into the pipeline to detect offensive or harmful content, using existing codeblocks for safety evaluation. The overall implementation will involve data flow between components, with the SCD dataset feeding into the model tuning process, the BOLD benchmark providing evaluation tasks, and safety classifiers ensuring output safety. New logic will be built to integrate these components, ensuring seamless operation and comprehensive evaluation of the hypothesis. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the equity of language model outputs, measured using the BOLD benchmark. This involves scoring the model's outputs against predefined bias metrics, with higher scores indicating more equitable outputs. The secondary metric will be safety, assessed using safety classifiers to detect offensive or harmful content. The proportion of outputs deemed safe will be measured, ensuring that the debiasing process does not compromise safety. Improvement will be interpreted as increased equity scores on the BOLD benchmark without a decrease in safety scores. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with results compared against a baseline model without SCD integration.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether Social Contact Debiasing (SCD) integration with BOLD benchmark improves language model equity without compromising safety. The experiment should have three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nPart 1 - Dataset Generation:\n1.

The hybrid attention mechanism combines channel and spatial attention, allowing the model to capture both global and contextual information effectively. This approach is hypothesized to outperform models that solely use pairwise distance features, which focus on calculating distances between object pairs. The hybrid attention mechanism is expected to provide a more comprehensive understanding of spatial relations by leveraging both spatial and channel dimensions, thus improving the model's ability to interpret complex spatial scenarios. The effectiveness of this integration will be evaluated using the mean Average Precision (mAP) metric on spatial relation reasoning tasks, with the Nr3D dataset serving as the benchmark. This study aims to demonstrate that the hybrid attention mechanism can significantly enhance the model's performance by providing a richer set of spatial information, addressing the limitations of existing models that rely solely on distance features. \nKey Variables:\nHybrid Attention Mechanism: The hybrid attention mechanism integrates both channel and spatial attention to capture global and contextual information. It allows the model to focus on different regions and feature channels within an image, enhancing its ability to interpret spatial relations. This mechanism is implemented by integrating attention mechanisms into both spatial and channel dimensions, enabling the model to capture important information more effectively. The hybrid attention mechanism is expected to improve the model's performance in spatial relation reasoning tasks by providing a comprehensive understanding of spatial relationships. It is particularly useful for complex visual recognition tasks where multiple types of attention are needed to achieve optimal results.\nPairwise Distance Features: Pairwise distance features involve calculating the distances between pairs of objects within the feature map. This approach is beneficial for view-independent sentences that include distance-related spatial relations such as 'next to' and 'farthest from'. The model uses these distances to enhance its understanding of spatial relations by focusing on the relative positioning of objects. This method is implemented by encoding the distances into the model's spatial reasoning process, allowing it to better interpret and respond to spatial queries. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by its ability to improve performance in scenarios where distance is a key factor in understanding spatial relationships.\nMean Average Precision (mAP): Mean Average Precision (mAP) is a comprehensive metric used to evaluate the performance of object detection models, including those with spatial reasoning capabilities. It calculates the average precision across multiple recall levels and is particularly effective in assessing the model's ability to detect and correctly classify spatial relations across different thresholds. Implementation involves using datasets like Nr3D, where the model's predictions are evaluated at various confidence levels to compute precision-recall curves. mAP provides a single scalar value that summarizes the model's performance across all classes and is widely used in competitions and benchmarks to compare different models.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating a hybrid attention mechanism into a vision-language model. The existing codeblock for vision-language model implementation will be adapted to include the hybrid attention mechanism, which combines channel and spatial attention. This integration will involve modifying the model architecture to incorporate attention mechanisms in both spatial and channel dimensions. The Nr3D dataset will be used to evaluate the model's performance in spatial relation reasoning tasks. The model's predictions will be assessed using the mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, which will be calculated by evaluating the model's predictions at various confidence levels to compute precision-recall curves. The control condition will involve a baseline model that uses pairwise distance features without the hybrid attention mechanism. The implementation will require building new components to integrate the hybrid attention mechanism and adapting existing codeblocks for model evaluation and metric calculation. The data flow will involve feeding input images and language queries into the model, which will then process the information using the hybrid attention mechanism to generate predictions. The predictions will be compared against ground-truth annotations to calculate mAP, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be mean Average Precision (mAP), which provides a comprehensive assessment of the model's ability to detect and correctly classify spatial relations across different thresholds. The mAP will be calculated using the Nr3D dataset, where the model's predictions will be evaluated at various confidence levels to compute precision-recall curves. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher mAP value compared to the baseline model using pairwise distance features. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and the results will be compared to determine the effectiveness of the hybrid attention mechanism in enhancing spatial relation reasoning capabilities.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to evaluate whether integrating a hybrid attention mechanism into vision-language models improves their performance in spatial relation reasoning tasks.

The hypothesis is that this integration will improve the nDCG@10 performance by generating more accurate pseudo labels. TSDAE pre-training helps the model learn robust representations by reconstructing input sequences from corrupted versions, which enhances the model's ability to capture the semantic structure of domain-specific data. The query generator produces synthetic queries relevant to the target domain, while the cross-encoder assigns relevance scores, creating high-quality pseudo labels. This combination is expected to reduce noise in pseudo labels and improve retrieval performance by leveraging the strengths of each component. The research aims to address the limitations of existing methods by providing a more robust and effective approach to unsupervised domain adaptation in scientific article retrieval tasks. \nKey Variables:\nTSDAE Pre-training: TSDAE is a pre-training method that uses a transformer-based auto-encoder to learn robust representations by reconstructing input sequences from corrupted versions. It captures the semantic structure of domain-specific data, making it suitable for enhancing domain adaptation performance. In this research, TSDAE is integrated with the Generative Pseudo Labeling process to improve the quality of pseudo labels by providing more accurate semantic context. The expected outcome is an improvement in nDCG@10 performance due to the enhanced precision and recall of pseudo labels.\nQuery Generator with Cross-Encoder: The query generator produces synthetic queries relevant to the target domain, and the cross-encoder assigns relevance scores to these queries and their corresponding passages. This setup generates high-quality pseudo labels for unsupervised domain adaptation tasks. The combination of a query generator and cross-encoder is crucial for the effectiveness of the Generative Pseudo Labeling process, as it allows for the creation of a pseudo dataset that improves retrieval performance. The expected role is to enhance the precision and recall of pseudo labels, leading to better domain adaptation outcomes.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by integrating TSDAE pre-training with a query generator and cross-encoder in the Generative Pseudo Labeling process. The TSDAE pre-training will be used to learn robust representations by reconstructing corrupted input sequences, which will enhance the model's ability to capture the semantic structure of domain-specific data. The query generator will produce synthetic queries relevant to the target domain, and the cross-encoder will assign relevance scores to these queries and their corresponding passages. This setup will generate high-quality pseudo labels for unsupervised domain adaptation tasks. The implementation will involve using existing codeblocks for TSDAE pre-training and the query generator with cross-encoder, along with any necessary adaptations to integrate them into the Generative Pseudo Labeling process. The data will flow from the TSDAE pre-training to the query generator, which will produce synthetic queries, and then to the cross-encoder, which will assign relevance scores and generate pseudo labels. The hypothesis will be realized end-to-end in code by leveraging the strengths of each component to improve the precision and recall of pseudo labels, ultimately enhancing the nDCG@10 performance in scientific article retrieval tasks. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be nDCG@10, which measures the quality of the top 10 retrieved documents in terms of their relevance to the query. Precision and recall of pseudo labels will be secondary metrics, assessing the accuracy and completeness of the pseudo labels generated. The hypothesis will be tested using benchmark datasets for scientific article retrieval, with a control condition involving the Generative Pseudo Labeling process without TSDAE pre-training. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in nDCG@10 and enhanced precision and recall of pseudo labels compared to the control condition. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure reliability and statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment comparing TSDAE-enhanced GPL versus standard GPL for scientific article retrieval.

IRCoT involves interleaving retrieval steps with reasoning steps, ensuring that each reasoning step is grounded in factual information, which enhances the logical consistency of explanations. Explanation Regeneration via Information Bottleneck refines explanations by compressing irrelevant information and preserving useful content, thereby improving the clarity and coherence of the generated explanations. The combination of these techniques is expected to synergistically improve the interpretability and accuracy of the system by ensuring that the reasoning process is both factually grounded and logically coherent. This approach addresses gaps in existing methods by providing a structured mechanism for integrating retrieval and reasoning, which has not been extensively explored in prior research. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in explanation coherence and retrieval accuracy, measured by precision and recall, compared to baseline methods. \nKey Variables:\nInterleaved Retrieval with Chain-of-Thought (IRCoT): IRCoT is a technique that interleaves retrieval steps with reasoning steps in a Chain-of-Thought process. This involves using a retrieval system to fetch relevant information at each step of the reasoning process, which is then used to inform the next reasoning step. The implementation typically involves a combination of a language model and a retrieval system, such as a search engine or a database query system. This method is particularly useful for complex question answering tasks where external information is required to support the reasoning process. The expected role of IRCoT in this research is to ensure that each reasoning step is grounded in factual information, thereby enhancing the logical consistency and coherence of the explanations generated by the system.\nExplanation Regeneration via Information Bottleneck: Explanation Regeneration via Information Bottleneck involves refining explanations to reduce irrelevant information while preserving useful information for inference. This approach uses an information-theoretic view to learn an internal representation of the initial explanation, which is then used to generate a refined explanation. The implementation involves training a language model with a log-likelihood objective for language modeling and an information bottleneck principle to optimize the explanation quality. The expected role of this technique is to improve the clarity and coherence of the generated explanations by ensuring that they are concise and focused on relevant information.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate Interleaved Retrieval with Chain-of-Thought (IRCoT) and Explanation Regeneration via Information Bottleneck. The implementation will involve setting up a retrieval system that can fetch relevant passages at each step of the reasoning process. This will be combined with a language model capable of generating reasoning steps based on the retrieved information. The Explanation Regeneration component will be implemented using an information bottleneck approach to refine the explanations generated by the language model. The data flow will involve using the retrieval system to fetch passages, feeding these passages into the language model to generate reasoning steps, and then applying the information bottleneck technique to refine the explanations. The setup will include configuring the retrieval system, training the language model with the information bottleneck principle, and integrating these components to work together in a seamless manner. The expected inputs are open-domain questions, and the outputs will be coherent explanations and accurate retrieval results. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be explanation coherence and retrieval accuracy. Explanation coherence will be assessed by measuring the logical consistency and clarity of the generated explanations, using a metric such as coherence score or alignment with human-verified answers. Retrieval accuracy will be evaluated using precision and recall metrics, which measure the proportion of relevant passages retrieved and the proportion of relevant passages among those retrieved, respectively. The benchmark tasks will involve open-domain question answering datasets, and the control condition will be a baseline system without the integration of IRCoT and Explanation Regeneration. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in explanation coherence and retrieval accuracy compared to the baseline.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing baseline and experimental question answering systems on the HotpotQA dataset. The experiment should be implemented with three possible settings (PILOT_MODE: 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT').\n\nDataset:\n- Use the HotpotQA dataset from HuggingFace Hub, which contains questions requiring multi-hop reasoning and includes gold explanations.\n- For MINI_PILOT: Use 10 questions from training set\n- For PILOT: Use 200 questions from training set for development, 50 questions from validation set for evaluation\n- For FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full training/validation/test sets\n\nImplement two conditions:\n1.

Explanation Coherence:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini to rate explanation coherence (1-5 scale)\n- Compare against gold explanations\n\nExperimental Flow:\n1. First run MINI_PILOT:\n- Process 10 questions\n- Verify all components working\n- Generate preliminary metrics\n\n2. If MINI_PILOT successful, run PILOT:\n- Process training/validation split\n- Generate full metrics\n- Perform statistical comparison\n\n3. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT (requires manual verification)\n\nRequired Outputs:\n1. Detailed logs including:\n- Full question-answer-explanation trajectories\n- Retrieved passages\n- Intermediate reasoning steps\n- Evaluation metrics\n\n2. Summary statistics:\n- Average accuracy, precision, recall per condition\n- Average coherence scores per condition\n- Statistical comparison using bootstrap resampling\n\n3.

Use appropriate error handling and logging throughout. Report all results in both human-readable and machine-readable (JSON) formats. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Role Vector Enhancement\nShort Description: Exploring Role Vectors in GPT-3.5-turbo for improved logic puzzle solving.\nHypothesis to explore: Embedding Role Vectors in GPT-3.5-turbo enhances problem-solving abilities in logic puzzles compared to static persona configurations, as measured by task accuracy and completion time.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Embedding Role Vectors in GPT-3.5-turbo\nDependent variable: Problem-solving abilities in logic puzzles\nComparison groups: Role Vectors vs. static persona configurations\nBaseline/control: Static persona configurations\nContext/setting: Logic puzzles\nAssumptions: Role Vectors can be embedded in GPT-3.5-turbo\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not specified\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Task accuracy and completion time\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to explore the impact of embedding Role Vectors in GPT-3.5-turbo on problem-solving abilities in logic puzzles. Role Vectors are a novel approach that involves embedding personas directly into the model's activations, allowing for more structured guidance of the model's behavior. This method contrasts with static persona configurations, which do not adapt based on task inputs. The hypothesis posits that Role Vectors will enhance problem-solving abilities by providing a more dynamic and contextually relevant framework for the model's reasoning process. The expected outcome is an improvement in task accuracy and a reduction in completion time compared to static persona configurations. This study addresses gaps in existing research by exploring a new variable combination that has not been extensively tested in similar papers, offering a fresh perspective on enhancing LLM performance in specific tasks. \nKey Variables:\nRole Vectors: Role Vectors involve embedding personas directly into model activations, providing a structured method to guide LLM behavior. This approach allows LLMs to adopt specific roles, such as a 'Logic Puzzle Expert', impacting performance on tasks. The method involves identifying latent role directions within the activation space that enhance performance when leveraged. This approach contrasts with traditional persona-based prompting by focusing on internal model mechanisms. Role Vectors provide an alternative to dynamic persona configurations by embedding roles at a deeper model level, potentially enhancing problem-solving abilities in specific contexts.\nStatic Persona Configurations: Static persona configurations involve assigning a fixed set of personas to the language model throughout the task execution. This method is used as a baseline to compare the effectiveness of dynamic persona configurations. The implementation involves pre-selecting personas that are deemed relevant to the task at hand and maintaining these personas consistently during the problem-solving process. This fixed approach allows for a controlled environment to measure the impact of dynamic persona configurations on task performance, specifically in terms of accuracy and completion time.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the capabilities of CodeScientist, focusing on embedding Role Vectors into GPT-3.5-turbo and comparing its performance against static persona configurations. The process begins by designing Role Vectors that represent specific roles relevant to logic puzzles, such as 'Logic Puzzle Expert'. These vectors will be embedded into the model's activation space, guiding its reasoning process. The implementation involves adapting existing codeblocks to support Role Vector integration, requiring modifications to the model's architecture to accommodate these vectors. Static persona configurations will serve as the control condition, where the model is assigned fixed personas throughout the task. The experiment will involve running multiple instances of logic puzzles, measuring task accuracy and completion time as primary metrics. Data flow will be managed by the Experiment Builder, which will automatically create, run, and debug the experiment code in a container. The results will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of Role Vectors in enhancing problem-solving abilities compared to static persona configurations. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be task accuracy and completion time. Task accuracy will be measured by the number of correctly solved logic puzzles out of the total attempted, providing a direct assessment of the model's problem-solving abilities. Completion time will be recorded for each task, offering insights into the efficiency of the model's reasoning process. The control condition will involve static persona configurations, allowing for a comparative analysis of the impact of Role Vectors. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in task accuracy and a reduction in completion time compared to the control condition. The experiment will involve multiple runs to ensure reliability, with statistical confidence assessed using appropriate tests.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing two methods of providing role information to gpt-4o-mini for solving logic puzzles. The experiment should have the following components:\n\n1. DATA GENERATION:\nFirst, use the Data Generation with LLM codeblock to create a dataset of logic puzzles. Each puzzle should be a self-contained logical reasoning problem. For example:\n- MINI_PILOT: Generate 5 puzzles\n- PILOT: Generate 25 puzzles\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Generate 100 puzzles\n\n2. CONDITIONS:\na) Baseline (Static Role): Use a fixed prompt prefix: 'You are a logic puzzle expert. Your role is to solve logic puzzles step by step.'\nb) Experimental (Dynamic Role): Before each puzzle, generate a contextually-relevant role description based on the specific puzzle type/content. For example, if it's a sequence puzzle, the role might emphasize pattern recognition.\n\n3. EVALUATION PROCEDURE:\n- For each puzzle in the dataset:\n  * Record start time\n  * Present the puzzle to the model (with either static or dynamic role prompt)\n  * Request a solution\n  * Record end time\n  * Store the solution\n  * Store completion time\n\n4. METRICS:\n- Task Accuracy: Have the model (in a separate evaluation pass) score each solution as correct (1) or incorrect (0)\n- Completion Time: Time taken to generate each solution\n\n5. ANALYSIS:\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare accuracy and completion time between conditions\n- Generate line plots showing:\n  * Accuracy comparison between conditions\n  * Completion time comparison between conditions\n  * Learning curves (if any) over sequential puzzles\n\n6. PILOT SETTINGS:\nMINI_PILOT:\n- 5 puzzles\n- 2 runs per puzzle per condition\n- Basic statistical comparison\n\nPILOT:\n- 25 puzzles\n- 5 runs per puzzle per condition\n- Full statistical analysis\n- Visualization of results\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n- 100 puzzles\n- 10 runs per puzzle per condition\n- Comprehensive statistical analysis\n- Full visualization suite\n\n7. OUTPUT:\n- Log all prompts, responses, and timing data\n- Generate summary statistics for each condition\n- Create visualization plots\n- Report statistical significance of differences between conditions\n\nPlease implement this experiment starting with MINI_PILOT mode. Only proceed to PILOT mode if MINI_PILOT is successful.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Syntax-Aware Translation Enhancement\nShort Description: Investigating the impact of Syntax-Aware Word Representations on BLEU scores in machine translation.\nHypothesis to explore: The integration of Syntax-Aware Word Representations in machine translation models will significantly improve BLEU scores for languages with high syntactic similarity to English, compared to models without syntax-aware enhancements.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integration of Syntax-Aware Word Representations\nDependent variable: BLEU scores\nComparison groups: Models with syntax-aware enhancements vs. models without syntax-aware enhancements\nBaseline/control: Models without syntax-aware enhancements\nContext/setting: Languages with high syntactic similarity to English\nAssumptions: Syntax-aware enhancements are applicable and beneficial for languages with high syntactic similarity to English\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Machine translation models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: BLEU score assessment\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to investigate the impact of Syntax-Aware Word Representations on the translation performance of machine translation models, specifically measured by BLEU scores. By incorporating syntactic information into word representations, the hypothesis posits that translation quality will improve, particularly for languages that share high syntactic similarity with English. This approach leverages dependency parsers to enhance the syntactic understanding of the model, potentially leading to better alignment between source and target languages. The research will focus on comparing the BLEU scores of translations with and without syntax-aware enhancements, using a dataset of languages with varying degrees of syntactic similarity to English. The expected outcome is that syntax-aware models will outperform baseline models, especially for languages closely related to English, thereby demonstrating the value of syntactic information in improving translation quality. \nKey Variables:\nSyntax-Aware Word Representations: Syntax-Aware Word Representations involve training models with dependency parsers that provide syntactic annotations, which are then used to inform word representations during translation. This approach enhances the model's ability to capture grammatical structures, improving the alignment between source and target languages. The specific implementation involves using dependency parsers to generate syntactic annotations, which are integrated into the word representations used by the translation model. This variable is expected to directly influence translation quality, as measured by BLEU scores, by providing a more nuanced understanding of syntactic structures, particularly for languages with complex syntax.\nBLEU Score: The BLEU score is a metric used to evaluate the quality of text that has been machine-translated from one language to another. It is calculated by comparing the n-grams of the candidate translation with those of the reference translations and counting the number of matches. The BLEU score ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher score indicates better translation quality. In this research, BLEU scores will be used to measure the translation performance of models with and without syntax-aware enhancements, providing a quantitative assessment of the impact of syntactic information on translation quality.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, which allows for the design, iteration, and analysis of scientific experiments in Python. The implementation will involve two main components: a baseline translation model and a syntax-aware translation model. The baseline model will use standard word representations, while the syntax-aware model will incorporate Syntax-Aware Word Representations. Dependency parsers will be used to generate syntactic annotations for the syntax-aware model, which will be integrated into the word representations. The BLEU scores of translations produced by both models will be compared across a dataset of languages with varying syntactic similarities to English. The implementation will involve setting up the translation models, configuring the dependency parsers, and running translation experiments to collect BLEU scores. The CodeScientist system will automate the experiment setup, execution, and analysis, ensuring a systematic and reproducible evaluation of the hypothesis. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is the BLEU score, which measures the quality of machine-translated text by comparing it to reference translations. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the BLEU scores of translations produced by the baseline and syntax-aware models across a dataset of languages with varying syntactic similarities to English. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher BLEU score for the syntax-aware model compared to the baseline model, indicating that the integration of syntactic information enhances translation quality. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and the results will be analyzed to determine the significance of the observed differences.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether syntax-aware word representations improve translation quality. The experiment should have the following components:\n\n1. PILOT SETTINGS:\nCreate a global variable PILOT_MODE that can be set to 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT':\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 50 sentences from one language pair (English-German) for quick testing\n- PILOT: Use 500 sentences each from two language pairs (English-German, English-Dutch)\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use 5000 sentences each from four language pairs (English-German, English-Dutch, English-French, English-Spanish)\n\n2. DATA:\n- Use the Huggingface Datasets API to load parallel translation datasets\n- For MINI_PILOT and PILOT, use only training set data\n- For FULL_EXPERIMENT, use training/dev/test splits appropriately\n\n3. MODELS:\nCreate two conditions:\na) Baseline: Use gpt-4o-mini for direct translation\n   - Input format: 'Translate from English to [TARGET_LANG]: [TEXT]'\nb) Experimental: Use gpt-4o-mini with syntax-aware prompting\n   - First call: 'Analyze the syntax of this English sentence: [TEXT]'\n   - Second call: 'Translate this English sentence to [TARGET_LANG], preserving the following syntactic structure: [SYNTAX_ANALYSIS]. Sentence: [TEXT]'\n\n4. EVALUATION:\n- Calculate BLEU scores using NLTK for both conditions\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare baseline vs experimental conditions\n- Log all results, including:\n  * Individual translation outputs\n  * BLEU scores per sentence\n  * Average BLEU scores per condition\n  * Statistical significance results\n\n5. WORKFLOW:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT\n3. Stop after PILOT for human verification\n\n6. REQUIRED OUTPUT:\n- A results.json file containing:\n  * All translation outputs\n  * BLEU scores (individual and aggregate)\n  * Statistical comparisons\n- A summary.txt file containing:\n  * Key findings\n  * Statistical significance\n  * Recommendations for proceeding to full experiment\n\nPlease implement this experiment, ensuring proper error handling and logging throughout. The experiment should be reproducible and clearly documented. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

BERT embeddings provide rich semantic information, while ResNet models offer robust visual features. MAT introduces adversarial perturbations in both text and image modalities, training models to resist these perturbations. This combination is hypothesized to improve performance by leveraging the strengths of both semantic and visual features, addressing vulnerabilities in unimodal models. The study will compare the performance of this integrated approach against baseline models using unimodal features and standard training methods, focusing on robustness and generalization improvements. The expected outcome is a significant enhancement in model performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining semantic and visual features with adversarial training in NLP tasks. \nKey Variables:\nBERT Pre-trained Embeddings: BERT embeddings capture rich semantic information by learning contextual relationships between words. In this experiment, BERT embeddings will be used to represent textual data in sentiment analysis tasks. The embeddings will be extracted from the final layer of the BERT model and integrated into the NLP model to enhance semantic understanding. BERT was chosen for its high confidence and proven ability to improve performance in NLP tasks.\nResNet Pre-trained Model: ResNet models are used to extract robust visual features, trained on large-scale datasets to resist adversarial perturbations. In this study, ResNet will provide visual features that complement the semantic information from BERT embeddings. The integration of ResNet is expected to enhance the model's ability to handle adversarial attacks by providing a rich semantic understanding of visual inputs.\nMultimodal Adversarial Training (MAT): MAT incorporates adversarial perturbations in both text and image modalities during training. This approach is designed to enhance robustness by addressing challenges posed by multimodal attacks. MAT will be implemented to train the model to resist adversarial examples, leveraging one-to-many relationships in the data to improve alignment and diversity. This technique is expected to significantly outperform existing unimodal defenses in sentiment analysis tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for BERT embeddings and ResNet models. The BERT embeddings will be extracted using a pre-trained BERT model, which will be integrated into the NLP model to provide semantic features. ResNet pre-trained models will be used to extract visual features, which will be combined with the semantic features from BERT. Multimodal Adversarial Training (MAT) will be applied by generating adversarial examples for both text and image modalities, training the model to resist these perturbations. The implementation will involve setting up a training pipeline that incorporates MAT, using adversarial examples to enhance model robustness. The data flow will involve feeding input text into the BERT model to extract embeddings, which will be combined with visual features from ResNet. The integrated features will be used to train the model on sentiment analysis tasks, with MAT applied to improve robustness. The system will be evaluated using standard sentiment analysis datasets, comparing the performance of the integrated approach against baseline models using unimodal features and standard training methods. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the robustness of the NLP model, measured by its performance on adversarially perturbed test samples. Secondary metrics will include generalization performance on clean test samples and comparison against baseline models using unimodal features. The evaluation will involve standard sentiment analysis datasets, with metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and robustness gain. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant increase in robustness and generalization compared to baseline models, with statistical confidence assessed through multiple runs and significance testing.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether integrating BERT embeddings with ResNet and Multimodal Adversarial Training (MAT) improves robustness in sentiment analysis.

The hypothesis posits that this integration will lead to a significant improvement in execution success rates compared to traditional BLEU-based evaluation methods. MBR-EXEC with multiple test cases involves executing each candidate program on a diverse set of test cases, thereby providing a more comprehensive evaluation of each candidate's functionality. Unit test filtering further refines this process by generating and executing unit tests to filter out incorrect code. This combination is expected to enhance the robustness and reliability of the generated code by ensuring that only functionally correct programs are selected. The motivation for this research stems from the limitations of traditional BLEU-based evaluation methods, which often fail to capture semantic correctness. By focusing on execution results and leveraging unit test filtering, this approach aims to provide a more accurate assessment of code quality and functionality, addressing gaps in existing evaluation frameworks. \nKey Variables:\nMBR-EXEC with Multiple Test Cases: This variable represents the extension of the standard MBR-EXEC approach by executing each candidate program on multiple test cases. It involves sampling programs, executing them on a diverse set of test cases, and using the aggregated results to determine the program with the minimal Bayes risk. This method requires a larger set of test inputs and increased computational resources but is expected to improve the reliability of program selection by providing a more comprehensive evaluation of each candidate.\nUnit Test Filtering: Unit test filtering is a strategy that involves generating and executing unit tests to evaluate the correctness of generated code. It helps identify and filter out incorrect code by running it against a set of predefined test cases. This approach ensures that only code that passes the unit tests is considered correct, enhancing the robustness of the evaluation process. It is particularly useful in scenarios where execution-based evaluation is challenging, offering a robust alternative for assessing execution success by leveraging the functional similarities among candidate programs.\nExecution Success Rate: Execution success rate measures the percentage of generated programs that execute correctly on a set of test inputs. This metric is crucial for evaluating language-to-code models, as it directly reflects the model's ability to produce functional code. It is used as a primary metric in datasets like MBPP, where the ability to execute code correctly is a key indicator of model performance. The expected outcome is an improvement in execution success rates when using MBR-EXEC with multiple test cases and unit test filtering compared to traditional BLEU-based evaluation methods.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities, focusing on Python programming tasks. The implementation will involve the following steps: 1) Use the existing codeblock for MBR-EXEC to sample candidate programs from a pretrained code model like Codex. 2) Extend the MBR-EXEC approach by executing each candidate on multiple test cases, requiring the development of a new module to handle the aggregation of execution results. 3) Implement unit test filtering by generating unit tests for each candidate program and executing them to filter out incorrect code. This will involve building a new module for unit test generation and execution. 4) Compare the execution success rate of the proposed approach against a baseline using traditional BLEU-based evaluation methods. The data flow will involve sampling candidate programs, executing them on multiple test cases, applying unit test filtering, and selecting the program with the minimal Bayes risk. The expected output is an improved execution success rate, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the execution success rate, measured as the percentage of generated programs that execute correctly on a set of test inputs. Secondary metrics will include the exact match rate and BLEU score for comparison with traditional evaluation methods. The benchmark tasks will involve Python programming challenges from the MBPP dataset. The control condition will be a baseline agent using traditional BLEU-based evaluation methods. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in execution success rate compared to the baseline, with multiple runs to ensure reliability. Success will be indicated by a higher execution success rate, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of MBR-EXEC with multiple test cases and unit test filtering for Python programming tasks. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), with the following specifications:\n\nGlobal Configuration:\n- Set PILOT_MODE as a global string variable with possible values: 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'\n- Use gpt-4o-mini as the base model for all LLM calls\n- Load the MBPP dataset from Huggingface Hub\n\nPilot Modes:\n1.

The hypothesis posits that this integration will enhance the system's ability to accurately detect emotions in dialogues compared to static integration methods. The GAT will dynamically weigh the relevance of different knowledge triples from ConceptNet, allowing the model to focus on the most pertinent information for a given dialogue context. The dynamic knowledge selection method will further refine this process by adaptively choosing the most relevant knowledge representations based on emotion classification results. This approach addresses the limitations of static methods, which do not adapt to the changing context of conversations, by providing a more flexible and contextually aware integration of commonsense knowledge. The expected outcome is an improvement in the accuracy of emotion detection, as the system will be better equipped to understand the nuances of dialogue contexts and emotional cues. This research fills a gap in existing literature by exploring the combined use of GAT and dynamic knowledge selection in dialogue emotion detection, a combination not extensively explored in previous studies. \nKey Variables:\nCommonsense Knowledge Source: ConceptNet is selected for its extensive repository of general human knowledge in the form of triples, which can be integrated into dialogue systems to enhance natural language understanding. In this study, ConceptNet will be used to provide context and background knowledge that is not explicitly stated in the text, allowing the system to infer unstated information and generate more contextually relevant responses. The integration will be achieved using a Graph Attention Network (GAT), which will dynamically select and weigh the relevance of different knowledge triples based on the dialogue context. This approach is expected to improve the model's ability to detect and respond to emotions in conversations by providing a more nuanced understanding of the dialogue context.\nKnowledge Integration Method: The dynamic knowledge selection method involves a two-stage mechanism: competition and broadcasting. During the competition stage, irrelevant knowledge is recursively excluded based on the emotion status, while the broadcasting stage applies the remaining knowledge to unify the dialogue representation. This method allows the system to focus on the most relevant knowledge for a given context, improving the coherence and relevance of the generated responses. The integration of this method with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) is expected to enhance the model's ability to dynamically adapt to the changing emotional context of dialogues, providing a more accurate and contextually aware emotion detection.\nSemantic Similarity Measure: The Graph Attention Network (GAT) will be used to integrate knowledge into dialogue systems by applying attention mechanisms over graph-structured data. This involves constructing a graph where nodes represent dialogue components and edges represent semantic relationships informed by commonsense knowledge. The attention mechanism assigns weights to these edges based on their relevance to the current dialogue context, allowing the model to focus on the most pertinent information. This approach is particularly effective for dialogues that require deep contextual understanding, as it allows the model to explore complex relationships within the knowledge graph and integrate them into the dialogue.\nEmotional Congruence Measure: The emotion classification model will be used to determine the emotional congruence between dialogue context and commonsense knowledge. This involves using a supervised evaluation method where the emotion label acts as a coordination mechanism between the context and the knowledge representation. The model selects the most appropriate knowledge relations by evaluating the consistency with the context representation vector. The process involves a competition stage where irrelevant knowledge is recursively excluded based on emotion status, using a nonlinear regression method to calculate the dynamics of the exclusion process. The remaining knowledge representation, which aligns with the unified speaker's emotion status, is then used to refine the knowledge representation in the broadcasting stage.\nDialogue Emotion Detection Accuracy: The F1-score will be used as the primary metric for evaluating the accuracy of dialogue emotion detection. This metric is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single measure that balances both false positives and false negatives. The F1-score will be calculated by comparing the predicted emotion labels against the true labels in a test dataset, which includes diverse dialogue scenarios. This metric is crucial for assessing the model's performance in handling complex emotional transitions and thematic topics within conversations.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using a combination of existing and newly developed components. The Graph Attention Network (GAT) will be used to dynamically integrate commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet into the dialogue emotion detection system. This will involve constructing a graph where nodes represent dialogue components and edges represent semantic relationships informed by commonsense knowledge. The GAT will apply attention mechanisms to assign weights to these edges based on their relevance to the current dialogue context, allowing the model to focus on the most pertinent information. The dynamic knowledge selection method will be implemented to further refine this process by adaptively choosing the most relevant knowledge representations based on emotion classification results. This will involve a two-stage mechanism: competition and broadcasting. During the competition stage, irrelevant knowledge will be recursively excluded based on the emotion status, while the broadcasting stage will apply the remaining knowledge to unify the dialogue representation. The emotion classification model will be used to determine the emotional congruence between dialogue context and commonsense knowledge, using a supervised evaluation method where the emotion label acts as a coordination mechanism between the context and the knowledge representation. The F1-score will be used as the primary metric for evaluating the accuracy of dialogue emotion detection, providing a single measure that balances both false positives and false negatives. The implementation will involve setting up the GAT and dynamic knowledge selection method within a Python-based framework, using existing libraries and tools for graph processing and emotion classification. The system will be tested on a diverse set of dialogue scenarios to evaluate its performance in handling complex emotional transitions and thematic topics. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the F1-score, which is a harmonic mean of precision and recall. This metric provides a single measure that balances both false positives and false negatives, making it ideal for assessing the accuracy of dialogue emotion detection. The F1-score will be calculated by comparing the predicted emotion labels against the true labels in a test dataset, which includes diverse dialogue scenarios. This metric is crucial for assessing the model's performance in handling complex emotional transitions and thematic topics within conversations. The secondary metric will be precision, which measures the proportion of true positive emotion detections among all positive detections made by the model. Precision is particularly important in dialogue emotion detection to ensure that the system does not incorrectly label neutral or unrelated dialogue segments as emotional. The precision metric will be calculated using the predictions from the model, allowing researchers to determine how effectively the model distinguishes between relevant emotional cues and noise within the dialogue context. Both metrics will be reported alongside recall to provide a comprehensive view of the model's classification capabilities.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing baseline versus experimental methods for dialogue emotion detection. The experiment should have three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Use 10 dialogue examples from training set\n- Maximum 100 ConceptNet triples per dialogue\n- 5 epochs\n\nPILOT:\n- Use 100 dialogue examples from training set, 50 from dev set\n- Maximum 500 ConceptNet triples per dialogue\n- 10 epochs\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n- Use full training/dev/test sets\n- No limit on ConceptNet triples\n- 30 epochs\n\nImplementation Details:\n1. Create two conditions:\n   a) Baseline: Static knowledge integration\n      - For each dialogue, retrieve relevant ConceptNet triples once at the start\n      - Use gpt-4o-mini to classify emotions based on dialogue + static knowledge\n   b) Experimental: Dynamic GAT with knowledge selection\n      - For each dialogue turn, dynamically select relevant ConceptNet triples\n      - Use GAT to weight knowledge relevance\n      - Use gpt-4o-mini to classify emotions based on dialogue + dynamic knowledge\n\n2. For each dialogue:\n   - Extract relevant ConceptNet triples using the ConceptNet Knowledge Base\n   - Create knowledge graphs using DOT/Graphviz (save as PDFs)\n   - For experimental condition, update graphs each turn\n   - Log all intermediate results\n\n3. Evaluation:\n   - Calculate F1-score, precision, recall for both conditions\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to compare conditions\n   - Generate summary statistics\n   - Save all results to files\n\n4. Required outputs:\n   - Logs of all operations\n   - Knowledge graphs as PDFs\n   - Performance metrics\n   - Statistical comparison results\n   - Error analysis\n\nPlease implement the MINI_PILOT first. If successful, proceed to PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT for human verification.\n\nNote: Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM operations to maintain speed and cost efficiency. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Combined Legal Text Augmentation\nShort Description: Exploring combined data augmentation techniques for improved precision in legal case categorization.\nHypothesis to explore: Combining random insertion of punctuation marks with synonym replacement for data augmentation in legal case categorization will result in higher precision compared to using either technique alone.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Combination of random insertion of punctuation marks with synonym replacement\nDependent variable: Precision in legal case categorization\nComparison groups: Combination of techniques vs. each technique alone\nBaseline/control: Using either technique alone\nContext/setting: Legal case categorization\nAssumptions: The combination of techniques is feasible and applicable in the context\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Legal cases\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Precision measurement in categorization\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the synergistic effects of combining two data augmentation techniques—random insertion of punctuation marks and synonym replacement—on the precision of legal case categorization tasks. Random insertion of punctuation marks, as implemented in AEDA, preserves the semantic content while introducing syntactic variations, which can help models generalize better across different datasets. Synonym replacement, a component of EDA, increases lexical diversity by substituting words with their synonyms, thus enhancing the model's ability to understand semantically similar but syntactically different sentences. By integrating these techniques, the research aims to leverage the strengths of both methods: maintaining semantic integrity and introducing lexical variability. This combination is hypothesized to improve precision, particularly in identifying true positive cases, by providing the model with a richer and more varied training dataset. The study will compare the combined approach against each technique used in isolation, using precision as the primary metric. This research addresses the gap in existing literature where these techniques have been explored separately but not in conjunction, particularly in the context of legal text classification. \nKey Variables:\nRandom Insertion of Punctuation Marks: This technique involves inserting punctuation marks like '.', ';', '?', ':', '!', and ',' into sentences at random positions, with the number of insertions determined randomly between 1 and one-third of the sentence length. It aims to introduce syntactic variability while preserving the original semantic content, which is crucial for tasks like legal case categorization where maintaining the integrity of legal terms is important. This method is expected to enhance the model's robustness by exposing it to varied sentence structures without altering the meaning.\nSynonym Replacement: Synonym replacement involves substituting words in a text with their synonyms using resources like WordNet. This technique aims to increase lexical diversity by creating semantically similar but syntactically different sentences. In the context of legal text classification, it helps the model learn to recognize different expressions of the same legal concepts, thereby improving its ability to generalize across varied inputs. The effectiveness of this technique will be measured by its impact on precision, particularly in reducing false positives.\nPrecision: Precision is a metric that evaluates the accuracy of a classification model by measuring the number of true positive results divided by the number of all positive results, including false positives. In this study, precision will be used to assess the effectiveness of the combined data augmentation techniques in accurately identifying relevant legal cases. A higher precision indicates a reduction in false positives, which is crucial in legal contexts where the cost of misclassification can be significant.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using Python and existing NLP libraries. The random insertion of punctuation marks will be executed using a custom script that randomly selects punctuation marks and inserts them into sentences within a legal case dataset. Synonym replacement will be performed using the NLTK library's WordNet interface to identify and replace words with their synonyms. The legal case categorization task will be set up using a pre-trained BERT model, which will be fine-tuned on the augmented dataset. The experiment will involve three setups: using only random insertion of punctuation marks, using only synonym replacement, and using both techniques combined. Precision will be calculated for each setup to evaluate the effectiveness of the combined approach. The data flow involves loading the legal case dataset, applying the augmentation techniques, training the BERT model, and evaluating precision on a test set. The implementation will require building custom scripts for data augmentation and leveraging existing codeblocks for model training and evaluation. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is precision, which measures the proportion of true positive classifications among all positive classifications made by the model. This metric is crucial in legal case categorization to ensure that the model accurately identifies relevant cases while minimizing false positives. The experiment will involve comparing precision across three setups: using only random insertion of punctuation marks, using only synonym replacement, and using both techniques combined. The dataset will be split into training and test sets, and precision will be calculated on the test set for each setup. A higher precision in the combined setup compared to the individual techniques will indicate the success of the hypothesis. The evaluation will be conducted over multiple runs to ensure statistical significance.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment to test whether combining random punctuation insertion with synonym replacement improves precision in legal case categorization. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nData:\n- Use the 'legal_case_classification' dataset from Huggingface Hub (or a similar legal case dataset if unavailable)\n- For MINI_PILOT: Use 20 cases from training set\n- For PILOT: Use 200 cases from training set, 50 from dev set\n- For FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset\n\nData Augmentation:\n1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Integrated NER Enhancement\nShort Description: Combining Cooperative Learning, Template-based Demonstrations, and Dependency Triggers to improve NER in low-resource settings.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating Cooperative Learning with Dual Input Views, Template-based Demonstrations, and Dependency Triggers will significantly improve Named Entity Recognition performance in low-resource settings, as measured by F1 score, compared to using each approach individually.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating Cooperative Learning with Dual Input Views, Template-based Demonstrations, and Dependency Triggers\nDependent variable: Named Entity Recognition performance\nComparison groups: Using each approach individually\nBaseline/control: Using each approach individually\nContext/setting: Low-resource settings\nAssumptions: Not explicitly stated, but assumes integration will lead to improvement\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not specified\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: F1 score\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the synergistic integration of Cooperative Learning with Dual Input Views, Template-based Demonstrations, and Dependency Triggers to enhance Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low-resource settings. Cooperative Learning with Dual Input Views involves aligning outputs from two input views—one with the original sentence and another with additional context—using cooperative learning strategies. Template-based Demonstrations provide structured input formats that emphasize entity relationships, aiding the model's understanding of entity types. Dependency Triggers utilize syntactic parsers to identify key nodes in a sentence's dependency graph, serving as auxiliary signals for entity recognition. By combining these techniques, the research aims to leverage the strengths of each method: Cooperative Learning's ability to improve contextual representation, Template-based Demonstrations' enhancement of task understanding, and Dependency Triggers' precision in entity localization. This integration is expected to yield a more robust NER system capable of operating effectively with minimal labeled data, addressing gaps in previous studies that focused on these techniques in isolation. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in F1 scores, demonstrating the effectiveness of this multi-faceted approach in low-resource environments. \nKey Variables:\nCooperative Learning with Dual Input Views: This approach uses cooperative learning to align outputs from two input views: one with the original sentence and another concatenated with retrieved contexts. It enhances the model's contextual understanding by encouraging similar output distributions across views. This method is crucial for improving NER performance by leveraging external context effectively.\nTemplate-based Demonstrations: This involves creating structured input formats that highlight entity relationships. Templates guide the model in understanding the task by providing clear patterns to follow. This method improves the model's ability to generalize from limited data by emphasizing the relationship between entities and their types.\nDependency Triggers: Dependency Triggers are salient nodes in a sentence's dependency graph that aid in recognizing entity locations and types. By using syntactic parsers to identify these triggers, the model gains auxiliary signals that enhance its precision in entity recognition, particularly in complex sentences.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating specific codeblocks and resources. Cooperative Learning with Dual Input Views will be realized by adapting existing codeblocks for dual input processing, requiring minor modifications to align outputs. Template-based Demonstrations will involve designing templates that highlight entity relationships, using existing codeblocks for demonstration-based learning. Dependency Triggers will be implemented by integrating syntactic parsers to identify key nodes in the dependency graph, requiring moderate effort to build the necessary parsing logic. Data will flow through these components sequentially: sentences will first be processed to identify dependency triggers, then templates will be applied to structure the input, and finally, cooperative learning will align the outputs from dual input views. This integration will be achieved by building glue modules that connect these components, ensuring seamless data flow and interaction. The setup will involve configuring models to accept dual inputs, designing templates for demonstration-based learning, and implementing syntactic parsing for dependency triggers. The hypothesis will be tested end-to-end by evaluating the NER model's performance on benchmark datasets, comparing F1 scores with and without the integrated techniques. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is the F1 score, which combines precision and recall to measure the model's accuracy in identifying named entities. The hypothesis will be tested using benchmark NER datasets in low-resource settings, with a control condition involving the use of each technique individually. Success will be interpreted as a significant improvement in F1 scores when the integrated approach is used, compared to individual techniques. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with qualitative assessments derived from error analysis to identify specific areas of improvement.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated Named Entity Recognition (NER) system that combines Cooperative Learning, Template-based Demonstrations, and Dependency Triggers. The experiment should be implemented with three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nDataset:\n- Use the Huggingface Datasets API to load the 'conll2003' dataset, which is a standard NER dataset.\n- For MINI_PILOT: Use 10 sentences from the training set\n- For PILOT: Use 100 sentences from training set for training, 50 from validation set for evaluation\n- For FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use the full dataset\n\nModel Configuration:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini as the base model for all conditions\n- Implement four conditions:\n  1.

Counterfactual invariance ensures that model predictions remain unchanged when irrelevant input features are perturbed, thereby testing the robustness of models against input variations that should not affect the outcome. SHAP explanations provide a comprehensive view of feature importance, allowing for the identification of race-related biases by evaluating the impact of race-related features on model predictions. By integrating these two methods, the research aims to enhance the detection and mitigation of biases in NLP models, specifically focusing on the RedditBias dataset. The expected outcome is a significant reduction in race-related biases, as measured by the demographic parity difference, compared to models that utilize only SHAP explanations. This approach addresses gaps in existing literature by combining robustness testing with interpretability to provide a more comprehensive bias mitigation strategy. \nKey Variables:\nCounterfactual Invariance: Counterfactual invariance is a method that tests whether model predictions remain unchanged when irrelevant input features are perturbed. It is implemented by creating counterfactual scenarios and evaluating the model's consistency in its predictions, ensuring that only relevant features influence the outcome. This method is selected for its ability to reveal vulnerabilities in NLP models and ensure robustness against input variations. In this research, it will be operationalized by systematically perturbing non-essential input features in the RedditBias dataset and assessing the model's prediction consistency.\nSHAP Explanations: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a framework for interpreting predictions by assigning each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. It is based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory, ensuring a fair distribution of the prediction among the features. SHAP values are computed by considering all possible combinations of features, providing a comprehensive view of feature importance. In this research, SHAP will be used to identify race-related biases by evaluating the impact of race-related features on model predictions in the RedditBias dataset. The method is chosen for its robustness in diagnosing and mitigating biases in NLP models.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate counterfactual invariance with SHAP explanations. The process begins with the application of counterfactual invariance, where the RedditBias dataset is perturbed to create counterfactual scenarios. This involves systematically altering non-essential input features to test the model's prediction consistency. Next, SHAP explanations are applied to the model outputs to assign importance values to each feature, highlighting those contributing to race-related biases. The integration of these methods will involve developing a pipeline where counterfactual scenarios are generated, and SHAP values are computed for each scenario. Existing codeblocks for SHAP computation will be utilized, while new codeblocks will be built to implement counterfactual invariance. The data flow involves feeding the perturbed dataset into the model, extracting predictions, and applying SHAP to interpret these predictions. The final output will be a set of SHAP values for each counterfactual scenario, providing insights into feature importance and bias presence. The hypothesis will be realized by comparing the demographic parity difference before and after the integration of these methods. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is the demographic parity difference, which measures the difference in the probability of a favorable outcome across different demographic groups. This metric will be calculated by comparing the proportion of positive outcomes for each racial group in the RedditBias dataset before and after applying the integrated methods. A reduction in the demographic parity difference will indicate a successful bias mitigation. Secondary metrics include the consistency of model predictions across counterfactual scenarios and the SHAP value distribution for race-related features. The hypothesis will be tested by running multiple iterations of the experiment, ensuring statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether integrating counterfactual invariance with SHAP explanations reduces race-related biases in NLP models. The experiment should be implemented as a series of pilot studies.\n\nGLOBAL PARAMETERS:\n- Set PILOT_MODE to one of: ['MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', 'FULL_EXPERIMENT']\n- Use gpt-4o-mini as the base model\n\nDATASET:\n- Use the RedditBias dataset from Huggingface\n- MINI_PILOT: 10 random examples from training set\n- PILOT: 100 random examples from training set, 50 from dev set\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Full dataset (but do not run this yet)\n\nCONDITIONS:\n1.

The Chain of Draft (CoD) approach focuses on generating concise, informative intermediate reasoning outputs, which reduces computational overhead and speeds up decision-making. The Scene Graph Simulator provides real-time feedback by visually representing the environment and updating state transitions and action outcomes. This integration aims to leverage the strengths of both methods: CoD's efficiency in processing critical insights and the Scene Graph Simulator's ability to provide immediate feedback for dynamic adaptation. By combining these techniques, the research seeks to enhance the adaptability and precision of decision-making processes in environments where rapid changes and spatial reasoning are crucial. The expected outcome is a more efficient and accurate navigation system that can quickly adapt to environmental changes, thereby improving overall task performance. This approach addresses gaps in existing literature by exploring a novel combination of techniques that have not been extensively tested together, offering potential improvements in both speed and accuracy. \nKey Variables:\nChain of Draft (CoD) Approach: The Chain of Draft (CoD) approach involves generating minimalistic yet informative intermediate reasoning outputs at each step of the reasoning process. This method focuses computational effort on critical insights necessary to advance towards the solution, significantly reducing token usage and latency. CoD is particularly valuable in resource-constrained or time-sensitive environments, such as real-time clinical decision support. In this research, CoD will be implemented to streamline the reasoning process in robotic navigation tasks, ensuring that computational resources are focused on critical insights and calculations, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.\nScene Graph Simulator: The Scene Graph Simulator is a tool used to derive real-time feedback by simulating the environment and providing updates on state transitions and action outcomes. It involves creating a visual representation of the environment where each node represents an object or state, and edges represent relationships or actions. As actions are taken, the simulator updates the graph to reflect changes, providing immediate feedback on the success or failure of actions. This feedback is then used to iteratively adjust strategies until a successful plan is formed. The simulator is particularly effective for tasks requiring spatial reasoning and dynamic adaptation, as it allows for real-time visualization and adjustment of strategies based on environmental changes.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating the Chain of Draft (CoD) approach with the Scene Graph Simulator. The CoD approach will be used to generate concise reasoning drafts at each step, focusing on critical insights necessary for decision-making. The Scene Graph Simulator will provide real-time feedback by simulating the environment and updating state transitions and action outcomes. The integration will involve setting up the Scene Graph Simulator to continuously monitor the environment and provide feedback to the CoD process. This feedback will be used to iteratively adjust the reasoning strategy, ensuring that the system adapts to environmental changes in real-time. The implementation will require building a module to interface between the CoD outputs and the Scene Graph Simulator inputs, ensuring seamless data flow and feedback integration. The system will be tested in a simulated robotic navigation environment, where the effectiveness of the integrated approach will be evaluated based on decision-making speed and accuracy. The setup will involve configuring the simulator to represent the task environment, initializing the CoD process, and running multiple iterations to assess performance improvements. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be decision-making speed and accuracy. Decision-making speed will be measured by the time taken to reach a decision from the initial prompt to the final output. Accuracy will be assessed by the correctness of the decisions made, evaluated against a set of predefined correct paths or actions in the simulated environment. The control condition will involve using the CoD approach alone, without the Scene Graph Simulator integration. The performance of the integrated system will be compared to this baseline to determine improvements in speed and accuracy. Success will be interpreted as a significant reduction in decision-making time and an increase in accuracy compared to the baseline. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with results analyzed to identify any patterns or trends in performance improvements.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing a baseline Chain-of-Draft (CoD) agent against an experimental CoD+Scene Graph agent in TextWorldExpress's CookingWorld environment.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Entropy-Enhanced KAFT\nShort Description: Investigating attention score entropy's impact on KAFT's effectiveness in improving LLM controllability and robustness.\nHypothesis to explore: Increasing attention score entropy in transformer models during n-back tasks will enhance the effectiveness of Knowledge Aware FineTuning (KAFT) in improving model controllability and robustness, as evidenced by higher QA task accuracy and better context relevance handling.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Attention score entropy in transformer models\nDependent variable: Effectiveness of Knowledge Aware FineTuning (KAFT)\nComparison groups: Not explicitly mentioned\nBaseline/control: Not explicitly mentioned\nContext/setting: During n-back tasks\nAssumptions: Increasing attention score entropy will lead to enhanced KAFT effectiveness\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Transformer models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: QA task accuracy and context relevance handling\n\nLong Description: Description: This research investigates the impact of attention score entropy on the effectiveness of Knowledge Aware FineTuning (KAFT) in improving the controllability and robustness of large language models (LLMs) during QA tasks. Attention score entropy measures the dispersion of attention in transformer models, which could potentially enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant information. By integrating this with KAFT, which uses counterfactual data augmentation to improve model controllability, we hypothesize that higher attention score entropy will lead to better handling of context relevance and improved QA task accuracy. This approach addresses the limitations of existing models that struggle with irrelevant contexts and provides a novel method to enhance model performance without extensive retraining. The expected outcome is a more robust model that can accurately prioritize relevant context over parametric knowledge, thereby improving its performance in noisy environments. \nKey Variables:\nAttention Score Entropy: Attention score entropy quantifies the dispersion of attention in transformer models during n-back tasks. It is calculated by analyzing the entropy of the attention score matrix, which indicates how attention is distributed across different positions. Higher entropy suggests a broader distribution, potentially allowing the model to better focus on relevant information. This variable is crucial for understanding how attention mechanisms can be optimized to enhance working memory capacity and model performance. In this study, we will measure attention score entropy during n-back tasks and assess its impact on KAFT's effectiveness in improving model controllability and robustness.\nKnowledge Aware FineTuning (KAFT): KAFT is a fine-tuning method designed to enhance the controllability and robustness of LLMs by incorporating counterfactual data augmentations. This involves creating training examples where the context contains plausible but incorrect entities, forcing the model to rely on context rather than parametric knowledge. KAFT is implemented using models like T5 and PaLM, and its effectiveness is evaluated through QA tasks. In this study, KAFT will be used to assess how attention score entropy influences the model's ability to handle context relevance and improve QA task accuracy.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to design and run experiments. First, we will use existing codeblocks to calculate attention score entropy during n-back tasks using transformer models like T5 and PaLM. This involves analyzing the attention score matrix to determine the dispersion of attention. Next, we will implement KAFT by creating counterfactual data augmentations and integrating them into the model's training process. The model will then be evaluated on QA tasks to assess its controllability and robustness. We will compare the performance of models with varying levels of attention score entropy to determine its impact on KAFT's effectiveness. Data will flow from the attention score calculation to the KAFT implementation, with outputs including QA task accuracy and context relevance handling metrics. Any new logic or integration layers required for this process will be built using Python, ensuring seamless interaction between components. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are QA task accuracy and context relevance handling. QA task accuracy will be measured by comparing the model's responses to a benchmark QA dataset, assessing how many answers are correct. Context relevance handling will be evaluated by analyzing the model's ability to prioritize relevant context over parametric knowledge, using a predefined benchmark that includes contexts implying answers contradicting the model's pretrained knowledge. Improvement will be interpreted as higher accuracy and better context handling compared to baseline models without enhanced attention score entropy. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment comparing baseline KAFT with entropy-enhanced KAFT, using gpt-4o-mini as the base model. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable.\n\nExperimental Setup:\n1.

Metrics to collect:\n   - Attention score entropy values\n   - QA task accuracy\n   - Context relevance scores\n   - Training time\n   - Inference time\n\n5. Analysis:\n   - Compare conditions using bootstrap resampling\n   - Plot entropy values vs performance\n   - Generate summary statistics\n   - Create performance comparison plots\n\n6. Output Requirements:\n   - Save all raw data as JSON\n   - Generate summary plots as PDF\n   - Log all experimental parameters\n   - Report bootstrap comparison results\n\nThe experiment should first run MINI_PILOT. If successful, proceed to PILOT. Stop after PILOT - do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT (this requires manual verification and approval).\n\nAll results should include error bars/confidence intervals. The evaluation should focus on both absolute performance and relative improvement between conditions. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

Error pattern recognition involves using clustering techniques to identify recurring error patterns, which can reveal underlying issues not apparent from individual error analysis. The LEVA framework, known for its mixed-initiative exploration capabilities, will be augmented with this error analysis technique to provide users with deeper insights into model performance. By visualizing these error patterns within the LEVA's interactive stream visualization, users can better understand systemic issues and prioritize model improvements. This integration aims to address gaps in current LLM evaluation methods, which often lack the ability to efficiently identify and address recurring errors. The expected outcome is a more robust evaluation process that not only improves model interpretability but also enhances scalability by allowing for more targeted and efficient model refinement. \nKey Variables:\nError Pattern Recognition: Error pattern recognition involves identifying recurring patterns in the errors made by a model using clustering techniques like k-means or hierarchical clustering. This method is particularly useful for diagnosing systemic issues within a model by revealing common characteristics or conditions under which errors occur. In this research, error pattern recognition will be implemented to analyze error data from LLM outputs, allowing for the detection of patterns that indicate underlying model weaknesses. This technique was selected due to its ability to provide a more comprehensive understanding of model performance compared to traditional error analysis methods. The expected role of this variable is to enhance the interpretability of LLM evaluations by highlighting systemic issues that require targeted interventions.\nLEVA Framework: The LEVA framework integrates LLMs to enhance visual analytics across onboarding, exploration, and summarization stages. It facilitates mixed-initiative exploration by recommending insights based on system understanding, user interaction, and data. In this research, LEVA will be used as the primary platform for visualizing error patterns identified through error pattern recognition. The framework's interactive stream visualization capabilities will be leveraged to provide users with a dynamic and intuitive interface for exploring error patterns and their implications. The LEVA framework was chosen for its proven effectiveness in enhancing visual analytics and its ability to support user-driven exploration and model refinement.\n\nImplementation: The implementation of this hypothesis will involve integrating error pattern recognition into the existing LEVA framework. The process begins by collecting error data from LLM outputs, which will be processed using clustering algorithms like k-means to identify recurring error patterns. These patterns will be visualized within the LEVA framework using its interactive stream visualization capabilities. Existing codeblocks for clustering algorithms will be utilized to perform error pattern recognition, while the LEVA framework's visualization components will be adapted to display the identified patterns. A new integration layer will be built to facilitate the flow of data between the error pattern recognition module and the LEVA visualization components. This layer will handle data preprocessing, clustering execution, and visualization rendering. The overall implementation will involve setting up the LEVA framework, configuring the clustering algorithms, and developing the integration layer to ensure seamless data flow and visualization. The hypothesis will be realized by evaluating the enhanced LEVA framework's ability to improve interpretability and scalability in LLM evaluations through user studies and performance metrics. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating this hypothesis will be interpretability and scalability. Interpretability will be assessed through user studies, where participants will interact with the enhanced LEVA framework to explore error patterns and provide qualitative feedback on their understanding and insights gained. Scalability will be measured by the framework's ability to handle increasing data volumes and complexity without significant performance degradation. This will be evaluated through stress testing with large datasets and monitoring system performance metrics such as processing time and resource utilization. Success will be indicated by improved user comprehension scores and the framework's ability to efficiently process and visualize large error datasets. The evaluation will include multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate whether integrating error pattern recognition with the LEVA framework enhances LLM evaluation interpretability and scalability.

The SGAN is designed to encode syntactic structures by constructing a graph where nodes represent tokens and edges represent syntactic dependencies. This graph-based approach allows the model to focus on syntactic relationships, potentially improving its understanding of complex linguistic patterns. The MMLM, on the other hand, is trained to predict masked tokens in multilingual corpora, capturing language-invariant features. By combining these two approaches, the hypothesis is that the model will achieve a more nuanced understanding of language, leading to improved NER performance. This integration is expected to bridge typological gaps across languages, leveraging syntactic dependencies to enhance cross-lingual transfer capabilities. The research will evaluate the model's performance on benchmark datasets, comparing it to a baseline model using only the MMLM. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in NER performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating syntactic knowledge with multilingual pre-training. \nKey Variables:\nSyntactic-Based Graph Attention Network: The SGAN is a network designed to encode syntactic structures by constructing a graph representation of input sentences. Nodes represent tokens, and edges represent syntactic dependencies, allowing the model to focus on important syntactic relationships. This approach enhances the model's ability to capture complex linguistic patterns, crucial for tasks like NER. The SGAN will be implemented using existing graph attention network libraries, and its effectiveness will be measured by improvements in NER performance.\nMultilingual Masked Language Model: The MMLM is a pre-training task where models predict masked tokens in multilingual corpora, capturing language-invariant features. It is implemented using a transformer architecture and trained on large-scale multilingual datasets. The MMLM provides a shared feature space among languages, enhancing cross-lingual transfer capabilities. Its role in the research is to provide a robust baseline for evaluating the impact of integrating syntactic knowledge through the SGAN.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by integrating a Syntactic-Based Graph Attention Network (SGAN) with a Multilingual Masked Language Model (MMLM). The SGAN will be constructed using existing graph attention network libraries, focusing on encoding syntactic structures from input sentences. The MMLM will be implemented using a transformer architecture, pre-trained on large-scale multilingual datasets to capture language-invariant features. The integration will involve feeding the syntactic representations from the SGAN into the MMLM, allowing the model to leverage both syntactic and semantic information. The implementation will require setting up data pipelines for processing multilingual corpora, constructing syntactic graphs, and training the combined model. The model's performance will be evaluated on named entity recognition tasks using benchmark datasets, comparing it to a baseline model using only the MMLM. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in NER performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating syntactic knowledge with multilingual pre-training. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the F1 Score, which combines precision and recall to provide a balanced measure of NER performance. The model's performance will be compared to a baseline model using only the MMLM, with improvements in F1 Score indicating successful integration of syntactic knowledge. Secondary metrics may include precision and recall separately, providing additional insights into the model's ability to correctly identify and classify named entities. The evaluation will be conducted on benchmark datasets, ensuring that the results are robust and generalizable across multiple languages.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment series comparing a baseline Multilingual Masked Language Model (MMLM) against an experimental model that integrates MMLM with a Syntactic-Based Graph Attention Network (SGAN) for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT.\n\n2. DATA PREPARATION:\n- Use the Huggingface Datasets API to load the 'wikiann' dataset, which contains multilingual NER annotations\n- For each sentence, create a syntactic graph where:\n  * Nodes are tokens\n  * Edges represent syntactic dependencies\n  * Use spaCy for dependency parsing\n  * Save visualizations of the graphs using DOT/Graphviz\n\n3. MODELS:\nBaseline Model:\n- Use XLM-RoBERTa-base as the MMLM (via Huggingface)\n- Fine-tune directly on NER task\n\nExperimental Model:\n- Use XLM-RoBERTa-base as the MMLM\n- Implement SGAN using DGL (Deep Graph Library)\n- Integrate SGAN outputs with MMLM\n\n4. EVALUATION:\n- Primary metric: F1 Score for NER\n- Secondary metrics: Precision and Recall\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare baseline and experimental conditions\n- Generate plots showing performance across languages\n\n5. LOGGING AND VISUALIZATION:\n- Log all experimental parameters\n- Log training progress\n- Log evaluation metrics\n- Save syntactic graphs as PDFs\n- Generate performance comparison plots\n\n6. ANALYSIS:\n- Compare F1 scores between baseline and experimental conditions using bootstrap resampling\n- Generate per-language performance analysis\n- Create error analysis using gpt-4o-mini to categorize error types\n\n7.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Queue-Enhanced Transformer-XL\nShort Description: Integrating Neural Queue Architecture into Transformer-XL to improve multi-document QA performance.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating a Neural Queue Architecture into Transformer-XL models will enhance their performance on multi-document question answering tasks in the ZeroSCROLLS benchmark, measured by improvements in accuracy and F1 score, compared to models without this integration.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integration of a Neural Queue Architecture into Transformer-XL models\nDependent variable: Performance on multi-document question answering tasks\nComparison groups: Models with Neural Queue Architecture integration vs. models without integration\nBaseline/control: Models without Neural Queue Architecture integration\nContext/setting: ZeroSCROLLS benchmark\nAssumptions: The integration of Neural Queue Architecture is feasible and applicable to Transformer-XL models\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Transformer-XL models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Improvements in accuracy and F1 score\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of the Neural Queue Architecture into Transformer-XL models to improve performance on multi-document question answering tasks within the ZeroSCROLLS benchmark. The Neural Queue Architecture, with its unbounded differentiable memory structure, is designed to enhance the computational power of recurrent networks by managing sequences of data more effectively. By incorporating this architecture, the Transformer-XL model is expected to better handle long-term dependencies and complex data sequences, which are crucial for multi-document question answering tasks. The hypothesis posits that this integration will lead to significant improvements in accuracy and F1 score compared to baseline Transformer-XL models without the Neural Queue Architecture. This research aims to address the limitations of current models in handling extensive sequences and complex data relationships, providing a novel approach to enhancing language model performance in challenging benchmark tasks. \nKey Variables:\nNeural Queue Architecture: The Neural Queue Architecture is a memory-augmented model that extends the capabilities of standard LSTMs by incorporating an unbounded differentiable memory structure in the form of a queue. This architecture is particularly effective for tasks requiring sequential processing, such as language modeling. The queue operates by enqueuing and dequeuing elements in a differentiable manner, allowing the model to manage sequences of data more effectively. This approach enhances the model's ability to handle long-term dependencies and complex data sequences, making it a suitable choice for integration with Transformer-XL models to improve performance on multi-document question answering tasks.\nTransformer-XL: Transformer-XL is an extension of the vanilla Transformer that introduces a recurrence mechanism to capture longer-term dependencies beyond the fixed-length context window. It caches hidden states of previous segments and reuses them in future computations, effectively creating a memory of past information. This architecture is particularly effective in tasks requiring long context processing, such as language modeling and question answering. By integrating the Neural Queue Architecture, Transformer-XL is expected to further enhance its ability to manage long-term dependencies and complex data sequences, leading to improved performance on multi-document question answering tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by integrating the Neural Queue Architecture into the Transformer-XL model using CodeScientist's capabilities. The existing codeblock for Transformer-XL will be utilized as the base model. A new module implementing the Neural Queue Architecture will be built to interface with the Transformer-XL's memory mechanism. This module will manage the queue operations, allowing the model to enqueue and dequeue elements in a differentiable manner. The integration will involve modifying the Transformer-XL's memory management system to incorporate the queue's operations, ensuring seamless interaction between the two architectures. Data will flow from the input through the Transformer-XL layers, with the Neural Queue Architecture managing the memory operations. The output will be processed by the Transformer-XL's decoder, with the queue's influence reflected in the model's predictions. This setup will be tested on the ZeroSCROLLS benchmark, with performance evaluated based on accuracy and F1 score. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are accuracy and F1 score on the ZeroSCROLLS benchmark. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the performance of the Transformer-XL model with and without the Neural Queue Architecture integration. The control condition will be the baseline Transformer-XL model without the queue integration. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in accuracy and F1 score, with multiple runs conducted to ensure reliability. The benchmark tasks will involve multi-document question answering, with the model's ability to handle long-term dependencies and complex data sequences being the focus of evaluation.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing a baseline Transformer-XL model against a Neural Queue-enhanced Transformer-XL model on multi-document question answering tasks from the ZeroSCROLLS benchmark. The experiment should proceed as follows:\n\n1. ARCHITECTURE:\n   - Baseline: Standard Transformer-XL model\n   - Experimental: Transformer-XL model integrated with a Neural Queue Architecture\n   - Both models should use gpt-4o-mini as the base LLM\n\n2.

EVALUATION METRICS:\n   - Primary metrics: Accuracy and F1 score\n   - Log full response trajectories\n   - Calculate and report mean, standard deviation for both metrics\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to test for significant differences between baseline and experimental conditions\n\n4. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE:\n   a) First run MINI_PILOT:\n      - Train/evaluate on 10 training set questions\n      - Verify basic functionality and logging\n      - Report preliminary metrics\n   \n   b) If MINI_PILOT successful, run PILOT:\n      - Train/tune on 100 training set questions\n      - Evaluate on 50 dev set questions\n      - Report detailed metrics and statistical comparisons\n      - Generate performance plots comparing baseline vs experimental\n\n5. LOGGING AND REPORTING:\n   - Log all model parameters\n   - Log all question/answer pairs and model responses\n   - Log accuracy and F1 scores per question\n   - Generate summary statistics\n   - Create performance comparison plots\n   - Include bootstrap resampling results\n\n6. REQUIRED OUTPUTS:\n   - Detailed logs of all runs\n   - Performance metrics (accuracy, F1) for both conditions\n   - Statistical comparison results\n   - Performance plots\n   - Error analysis of incorrect responses\n\nPlease implement the MINI_PILOT first. If successful, proceed to PILOT. Stop after PILOT - do not implement FULL_EXPERIMENT yet.\n\nNote: Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM operations as specified in the conditioning instructions. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

By applying Symbolic Chain-of-Thought Distillation (SCoTD) with a focus on diverse and high-probability rationale filtering, the study aims to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. The hypothesis posits that this approach will enable DistilGPT-2 to achieve accuracy levels comparable to larger models, such as those with billions of parameters, in mapping vulnerabilities to tactics. This research is motivated by the need for efficient, resource-conserving models that can perform specialized tasks without the computational overhead of larger models. The expected outcome is that SCoTD will allow DistilGPT-2 to effectively mimic the reasoning processes of larger models, thereby maintaining high accuracy in cybersecurity applications. This study addresses gaps in the literature by exploring the efficacy of SCoTD on a model smaller than those typically studied, providing insights into the scalability and efficiency of knowledge distillation techniques. \nKey Variables:\nModel Size: DistilGPT-2 with 82M parameters is chosen for its compact size and efficiency. It serves as a baseline to test the hypothesis that smaller models can perform complex reasoning tasks with the aid of SCoTD. The model's performance will be evaluated in the context of cybersecurity tasks, specifically vulnerability-to-tactic mapping, using precision and recall as metrics.\nSymbolic Chain-of-Thought Distillation (SCoTD): This technique involves training the DistilGPT-2 model on rationales sampled from a larger teacher model, focusing on diverse and high-probability rationale filtering. This approach is expected to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities, enabling it to perform complex tasks with fewer parameters. The effectiveness of SCoTD will be measured by the model's accuracy in cybersecurity tasks.\nCybersecurity Task Performance: The primary task is vulnerability-to-tactic mapping, a critical function in cybersecurity. The model's performance will be assessed based on its ability to accurately map vulnerabilities to tactics, using precision and recall as key metrics. This task serves as a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of SCoTD in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of smaller models.\n\nImplementation: The implementation will involve using the DistilGPT-2 model with 82M parameters as the baseline. Symbolic Chain-of-Thought Distillation (SCoTD) will be applied by sampling rationales from a larger teacher model, such as GPT-3, focusing on diverse and high-probability rationale filtering. The process will involve training DistilGPT-2 on these rationales to enhance its reasoning capabilities. The cybersecurity task of vulnerability-to-tactic mapping will be used as the benchmark. Precision and recall will be calculated to evaluate the model's performance. Existing codeblocks for DistilGPT-2 and SCoTD will be utilized, with additional logic built to handle rationale sampling and filtering. The experiment will be conducted using Python, leveraging libraries such as PyTorch for model implementation and evaluation. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the performance of DistilGPT-2 with and without SCoTD, using a labeled dataset for vulnerability-to-tactic mapping. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are precision and recall, which will assess the model's accuracy in mapping vulnerabilities to tactics. Precision measures the proportion of true positive results in all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive results in all actual positives. The model's performance will be compared to that of larger models to determine the effectiveness of SCoTD in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of DistilGPT-2. A labeled dataset will be used to calculate these metrics, and statistical analysis will be conducted to determine the significance of the results. Success will be indicated by DistilGPT-2 achieving comparable precision and recall to larger models, demonstrating the efficacy of SCoTD in improving the model's performance.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing DistilGPT-2 with and without Symbolic Chain-of-Thought Distillation (SCoTD) on vulnerability-to-tactic mapping tasks.

Chain-of-Thought prompting encourages LLMs to follow a logical reasoning process, which can help mitigate unconscious biases by guiding the model to consider multiple perspectives before generating text. Counterfactual Data Augmentation involves creating modified versions of text data by swapping gendered pronouns, which helps in balancing the dataset and reducing bias by exposing the model to diverse examples of pronoun usage. By integrating these two methods, the research aims to achieve a more equitable language generation process, reducing the prevalence of biased pronoun usage. This approach addresses gaps in existing literature by exploring a novel combination of techniques that have not been extensively tested together. The expected outcome is a significant reduction in gender bias, as evidenced by more balanced pronoun usage in LLM-generated text, contributing to fairer and more inclusive language models. \nKey Variables:\nChain-of-Thought Prompting: Chain-of-Thought prompting is a technique that structures prompts to guide LLMs through a logical reasoning process before generating an output. This method encourages the model to consider multiple perspectives, potentially reducing unconscious biases by promoting fairer predictions. In this research, Chain-of-Thought prompting will be implemented by designing prompts that simulate a reasoning process, encouraging the model to reflect on its pronoun choices. This technique is selected for its ability to mitigate biases by fostering critical thinking and reducing reliance on stereotypical associations. The expected role of this variable is to directly influence the model's reasoning process, leading to more equitable language generation.\nCounterfactual Data Augmentation: Counterfactual Data Augmentation involves creating modified versions of text data by swapping gendered pronouns to generate a balanced dataset. This method helps in mitigating gender bias by exposing the model to diverse examples of pronoun usage. Implementation requires careful curation of the dataset to maintain grammaticality and coherence, and it will be used during the training phase to reduce bias in the model's pronoun generation. This technique is chosen for its effectiveness in balancing the dataset and promoting fairer language generation. The expected role of this variable is to provide the model with a more diverse set of training data, reducing the likelihood of biased outputs.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the capabilities of CodeScientist, an end-to-end semi-automated scientific discovery system. The implementation will involve the following steps: First, Chain-of-Thought prompting will be applied by designing a series of interconnected prompts that guide the LLM through a logical reasoning process. These prompts will be crafted to encourage the model to consider multiple perspectives before generating text, focusing specifically on pronoun usage. Next, Counterfactual Data Augmentation will be employed by creating a dataset with gender-swapped pronoun examples. This dataset will be used to train the LLM, ensuring that it is exposed to diverse linguistic contexts. The integration of these techniques will be achieved by combining the Chain-of-Thought prompting logic with the augmented dataset during the training phase. The LLM will be configured to process these prompts and datasets, generating outputs that are analyzed for gender bias in pronoun usage. The implementation will leverage existing codeblocks for Chain-of-Thought prompting and data augmentation, with additional glue logic built to integrate these components seamlessly. The expected outcome is a reduction in gender bias, as evidenced by more balanced pronoun usage in the generated text. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the frequency and context of gendered pronoun usage in LLM-generated text. This will be assessed by analyzing the proportion of male, female, and neutral pronouns used in response to gender-neutral prompts. A secondary metric will involve measuring the semantic distance between gendered pronouns and other words in the text, using cosine similarity to assess bias in conceptual associations. The hypothesis will be tested using a benchmark dataset of gender-neutral prompts, with a control condition involving the LLM without the integrated techniques. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant reduction in biased pronoun usage and more balanced semantic associations, evaluated over multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting combined with Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) reduces gender bias in LLM-generated text. The experiment should be structured in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), with the following specifications:\n\nPILOT MODES:\n- MINI_PILOT: Generate and evaluate 10 scenarios from training set\n- PILOT: Generate and evaluate 100 scenarios from training set, evaluate on 50 scenarios from dev set\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Generate 1000 scenarios from training, evaluate on 200 from dev set and 200 from test set\n\nEXPERIMENT STRUCTURE:\n1. First, create a dataset generator that produces gender-neutral scenarios requiring pronoun generation. For example:\n   \"A person walks into a hospital. ___ is looking for the emergency room.\"\n   \"Someone left their laptop here. I wonder when ___ will return.\"\n\n2. Create four experimental conditions:\n   a) Baseline: Direct completion with gpt-4o-mini\n   b) CoT only: Add reasoning step before completion\n   c) CDA only: Use counterfactual augmentation\n   d) CoT+CDA: Combine both methods\n\n3. For Chain-of-Thought prompting, structure the prompt as:\n   \"Let's approach this step by step:\n   1. What do we know about the person?\n   2. What assumptions might we be making?\n   3. How can we avoid gender stereotypes?\n   4. What would be a fair pronoun choice?\n   Now, complete the text:\"\n\n4. For Counterfactual Data Augmentation:\n   - For each scenario, create variants by explicitly swapping pronouns\n   - Include these in the context window\n   Example:\n   \"Context examples:\n   A doctor finished their rounds. She returned to her office.\n   A doctor finished their rounds. He returned to his office.\n   A doctor finished their rounds. They returned to their office.\"\n\n5. Evaluation metrics:\n   a) Primary: Calculate pronoun distribution (he/she/they) across completions\n   b) Secondary: Measure semantic bias using cosine similarity between profession/role words and gendered pronouns\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STEPS:\n1. Initialize experiment with MINI_PILOT mode\n2. Generate the required number of scenarios based on pilot mode\n3. For each scenario:\n   - Run all four conditions (baseline, CoT, CDA, CoT+CDA)\n   - Store full prompts and responses\n   - Calculate pronoun distributions\n   - Calculate semantic distances\n4. Perform statistical analysis:\n   - Compare pronoun distributions across conditions\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to test for significant differences\n   - Generate plots of distributions\n\nREQUIRED OUTPUT:\n1. Log file containing:\n   - All prompts and completions\n   - Pronoun distribution per condition\n   - Semantic distance measurements\n2. Results file containing:\n   - Summary statistics for each condition\n   - Statistical comparison results\n   - Recommendations for proceeding to next pilot phase\n\nNOTE: The experiment should first run MINI_PILOT. If successful, proceed to PILOT, then stop. Do not proceed to FULL_EXPERIMENT without human verification of pilot results.\n\nAll LLM calls should use gpt-4o-mini through the proxy server. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

The TED model is a transformer-based unsupervised abstractive summarization system that leverages large-scale pretraining on unlabeled corpora and fine-tuning with theme modeling and a denoising autoencoder. This study will explore the hypothesis that combining TED with unsupervised domain adaptation using theme modeling will enhance the coherence and comprehensiveness of summaries. The TED model's ability to capture document styles and the theme modeling's focus on domain-specific topics are expected to synergize, resulting in summaries that are both coherent and contextually relevant. The evaluation will be conducted using ROUGE metrics to measure n-gram overlap and custom narrative coherence metrics to assess logical flow and factual consistency. This approach addresses the gap in existing literature by focusing on unsupervised methods for domain-specific summarization, particularly in the scientific domain, where factual accuracy and narrative flow are critical. \nKey Variables:\nTED Model: The TED model is a transformer-based unsupervised abstractive summarization system. It is initially pretrained on large-scale unlabeled corpora using the lead bias in news articles and then fine-tuned on target domains using theme modeling and a denoising autoencoder. This model is selected for its ability to handle various document styles and its superior performance on datasets like NYT, CNN/DM, and English Gigaword. In this research, TED will be used as the primary model for generating summaries, leveraging its pretraining and fine-tuning capabilities to adapt to the scientific domain.\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptation using Theme Modeling: This approach involves using theme modeling as part of the domain adaptation process in an unsupervised setting. It identifies and focuses on the main topics within a domain-specific corpus, helping generate summaries that are coherent and relevant to the key themes of the domain. The implementation involves a denoising autoencoder to refine the model's output, ensuring concise and focused summaries. This method is particularly useful for domains with well-defined thematic structures, such as scientific articles, where it allows the model to adapt without requiring labeled data.\nROUGE Metrics: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L are standard metrics for evaluating the quality of summaries by comparing the overlap of n-grams between the generated summaries and reference summaries. ROUGE-1 measures unigram overlap, ROUGE-2 measures bigram overlap, and ROUGE-L considers the longest common subsequence. These metrics will be used to quantitatively assess the performance of the summarization models in generating coherent and comprehensive summaries.\nCustom Narrative Coherence Metrics: These metrics evaluate the logical flow and consistency of summaries beyond traditional n-gram overlap measures like ROUGE. They may involve automated methods that assess sentence adjacency likelihood and the presence of hallucinated information in generated summaries. These metrics are crucial for assessing the quality of summaries in terms of readability and logical structure, particularly in the scientific domain where factual accuracy is paramount.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the TED model as the base summarization system. The TED model will be pretrained on large-scale unlabeled corpora to capture general language patterns and then fine-tuned using theme modeling to adapt to the scientific domain. The theme modeling process will involve identifying key topics within the scientific articles and using a denoising autoencoder to refine the summaries, ensuring they are concise and focused. The implementation will leverage existing codeblocks for the TED model and theme modeling, with additional code developed to integrate these components. The data flow will involve preprocessing scientific articles to extract key themes, feeding the processed data into the TED model for summary generation, and then evaluating the outputs using ROUGE and custom narrative coherence metrics. The integration will require building a new module to handle the theme modeling and denoising processes, ensuring seamless interaction with the TED model. The setup will include configuring the TED model's hyperparameters for optimal performance in the scientific domain, with inputs and outputs managed through a standardized interface to facilitate evaluation. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores, which measure the overlap of n-grams between the generated summaries and reference summaries. These metrics will provide a quantitative assessment of the model's performance in generating coherent and comprehensive summaries. Custom narrative coherence metrics will serve as secondary metrics, evaluating the logical flow and factual consistency of the summaries. The evaluation will involve comparing the performance of the TED model with and without unsupervised domain adaptation using theme modeling, using scientific articles as the benchmark dataset. Success will be interpreted as a statistically significant improvement in both ROUGE and custom narrative coherence metrics when using the combined approach. Multiple runs will be conducted to ensure robustness, with statistical confidence assessed through appropriate tests.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing TED model summarization with and without theme modeling enhancement.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Multilingual Legal Judgment Enhancement\nShort Description: Integrating hierarchical transformers and consistency constraints for improved multilingual legal judgment predictions.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating hierarchical transformer models with cross-task consistency constraints on the FSCS Cases Dataset will improve legal judgment prediction accuracy and explanation quality, as measured by F1-score and Clarity and Linking metrics, compared to using hierarchical transformer models alone.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating hierarchical transformer models with cross-task consistency constraints\nDependent variable: Legal judgment prediction accuracy and explanation quality\nComparison groups: Hierarchical transformer models with cross-task consistency constraints vs. hierarchical transformer models alone\nBaseline/control: Using hierarchical transformer models alone\nContext/setting: FSCS Cases Dataset\nAssumptions: Cross-task consistency constraints can be effectively integrated with hierarchical transformer models\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Legal judgments\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: F1-score and Clarity and Linking metrics\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to explore the integration of hierarchical transformer models with cross-task consistency constraints to enhance the accuracy and explanation quality of legal judgment predictions. The FSCS Cases Dataset, which includes multilingual legal cases in German, French, and Italian, will be used to train and evaluate the models. Hierarchical transformer models are known for their ability to process large volumes of text by structuring input data hierarchically, capturing complex legal reasoning. Cross-task consistency constraints ensure that predictions across different subtasks are logically consistent, aligning with legal logic. By combining these techniques, the study hypothesizes that the system will achieve higher prediction accuracy and explanation quality, as measured by F1-score and human evaluation metrics like Clarity and Linking. This approach addresses gaps in existing literature by focusing on the synergy between hierarchical processing and logical consistency, which has not been extensively explored. The expected outcome is a more robust and interpretable legal judgment prediction system that can handle multilingual legal texts effectively. \nKey Variables:\nHierarchical Transformer Models: Hierarchical transformer models are employed to process the entirety of judgment facts, structuring input data hierarchically to capture complex legal reasoning. This approach is expected to improve prediction accuracy and explanation quality by ensuring that all relevant information is considered. The models will be fine-tuned on the FSCS Cases Dataset, which includes multilingual legal cases, allowing them to handle complex legal texts in German, French, and Italian. The hierarchical structure enables the models to understand both the broader context and specific details of a case, enhancing the clarity and coherence of predictions.\nCross-task Consistency Constraints: Cross-task consistency constraints are used to ensure logical consistency across different subtasks in legal judgment prediction. This involves defining constraints that guide the model to maintain consistency between event extraction and judgment prediction. The implementation requires designing the system architecture to allow for cross-referencing between tasks, ensuring that the outputs of one task logically support the outcomes of another. This approach is expected to enhance explanation quality by providing coherent and logically consistent predictions, which are crucial for legal applications.\nFSCS Cases Dataset: The FSCS Cases Dataset is a multilingual legal judgment prediction dataset that spans 21 years and includes over 85,000 cases in German, French, and Italian. This dataset is crucial for training models to handle multilingual legal texts, ensuring that the system can process and analyze documents in these languages. The dataset includes diverse case types and legal terminologies, which are essential for developing models that can understand and predict legal judgments across different linguistic contexts. The implementation involves using this dataset to train language models that can capture language-specific nuances and legal terminologies, thereby enhancing the system's multilingual capabilities.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for hierarchical transformer models and cross-task consistency constraints. The FSCS Cases Dataset will be used as the primary data source. The hierarchical transformer models will be fine-tuned on this dataset to capture the complexities of multilingual legal texts. Cross-task consistency constraints will be implemented by designing the system architecture to allow for cross-referencing between event extraction and judgment prediction tasks. This will involve creating a pipeline where the output of one task serves as input to another, ensuring logical consistency. The models will be evaluated using F1-score for prediction accuracy and Clarity and Linking metrics for explanation quality. The implementation will involve setting up the data preprocessing pipeline, configuring the model architecture, and integrating the consistency constraints. The system will be tested on a subset of the FSCS Cases Dataset, with results compared to a baseline model using only hierarchical transformer models. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be F1-score for prediction accuracy and Clarity and Linking metrics for explanation quality. The F1-score will be calculated by taking the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance. Clarity will assess how well the predictions and explanations are structured, while Linking will evaluate the logical consistency between the explanation and the final judgment. The models will be tested on a subset of the FSCS Cases Dataset, with results compared to a baseline model using only hierarchical transformer models. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher F1-score and better human evaluation scores on Clarity and Linking metrics.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate whether integrating hierarchical transformers with cross-task consistency constraints improves legal judgment prediction accuracy and explanation quality. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nData Processing:\n1.

FULL_EXPERIMENT (not to be run initially):\n   - Full dataset\n   - 5 runs per case\n   - Complete evaluation suite\n\nMetrics to Calculate:\n1. F1-score for judgment prediction accuracy\n2. Clarity score (using gpt-4o-mini to rate explanation clarity 1-5)\n3. Linking score (using gpt-4o-mini to rate logical connection 1-5)\n\nRequired Outputs:\n1. Log file containing:\n   - Full model configurations\n   - Training progress\n   - Validation results\n   - Error cases and analysis\n\n2.

HARGPT, which excels in scenarios with limited labeled data, will be employed to process the raw sensor data. Feature extraction will transform this data into meaningful features, such as frequency components and statistical metrics, enhancing the model's ability to detect patterns indicative of health conditions. Noise reduction will further refine the data quality by filtering out irrelevant or erroneous data points, ensuring that the model receives high-quality inputs. This combination is expected to yield more precise and interpretable insights than using HARGPT alone, as it addresses both data quality and feature representation challenges. The study will evaluate the performance of this integrated approach using precision and interpretability metrics, comparing it against a baseline where HARGPT is used without these preprocessing techniques. \nKey Variables:\nModel Type: HARGPT is selected for its ability to perform zero-shot human activity recognition, which is advantageous in scenarios with limited labeled data. It will be implemented using chain-of-thought prompts to process raw sensor data, generating insights about human activities and health patterns. The model's ability to handle complex queries and generate insightful responses makes it a promising alternative for health monitoring applications.\nPreprocessing Techniques: Feature extraction and noise reduction are chosen to enhance data quality and representation. Feature extraction will involve techniques like Fourier transforms and statistical feature computation to identify patterns in heart rate and sleep pattern data. Noise reduction will apply filters to eliminate noise from sensor malfunctions or environmental conditions, ensuring that only relevant signals are retained. These techniques are crucial for improving the precision and interpretability of the insights generated by HARGPT.\nData Type: Raw time-series data will be used as it captures continuous physiological signals such as heart rate and sleep patterns. This type of data is essential for real-time health monitoring and provides a comprehensive view of physiological changes over time. The raw data will be preprocessed using feature extraction and noise reduction techniques before being fed into HARGPT for analysis.\nAccuracy of Insights: Precision will be the primary metric to evaluate the accuracy of insights. It will measure the number of true positive results divided by the number of all positive results, including false positives. This metric is crucial for ensuring that the insights generated are not only accurate but also relevant and specific to the health parameters being monitored.\nInterpretability of Insights: Natural language explanations will be used to enhance the interpretability of insights. HARGPT will generate human-readable descriptions of model outputs, translating complex data patterns into understandable language. This approach will involve training the model on datasets that include both raw data and corresponding explanations, allowing it to learn the mapping between the two.\n\nImplementation: The implementation will begin with the collection of raw time-series data from wearable sensors, capturing heart rate and sleep patterns. This data will undergo preprocessing using feature extraction techniques, such as Fourier transforms, to convert time-domain signals into frequency-domain representations. Statistical features like mean, variance, and entropy will also be computed to highlight key patterns. Noise reduction techniques will be applied to filter out irrelevant data points, ensuring high-quality inputs for the model. HARGPT will be implemented using chain-of-thought prompts to process the preprocessed data. The model will generate insights about human activities and health patterns, leveraging its zero-shot recognition capabilities. Natural language explanations will be generated to translate these insights into human-readable descriptions, enhancing interpretability. The entire process will be automated using Python, with codeblocks for data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation. The performance of the integrated approach will be evaluated using precision and interpretability metrics, comparing it against a baseline where HARGPT is used without preprocessing techniques. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision, which measures the accuracy of insights by evaluating the number of true positive results divided by the number of all positive results, including false positives. This metric is crucial for ensuring that the insights generated are accurate and relevant to the health parameters being monitored. The interpretability of insights will be evaluated using natural language explanations, where user studies will assess the clarity and usefulness of the generated narratives. The study will compare the performance of the integrated approach against a baseline where HARGPT is used without preprocessing techniques, using statistical tests to determine the significance of any observed differences.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing baseline HARGPT versus HARGPT with preprocessing for analyzing health data. The experiment should be implemented with three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nData Generation:\n1.

The FFT is employed to replace traditional self-attention mechanisms, leveraging its ability to perform convolution operations in the frequency domain, thus reducing computational complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n). This is combined with Sparse Model Utilization, which reduces the number of active parameters by pruning less significant weights, further decreasing memory usage and computation times. The hypothesis posits that this combination will lead to a more efficient Transformer model that maintains or enhances accuracy on NLP tasks. The motivation for this research stems from the need to reduce the computational and energy costs associated with large Transformer models, which have significant environmental impacts. By integrating FFT and sparse modeling, the research aims to provide a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional Transformer architectures, addressing gaps in current literature that primarily focus on either FFT or sparse models independently. The expected outcome is a Transformer model that achieves comparable or superior performance with reduced computational resources, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices. \nKey Variables:\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT) for Efficient Computation: The FFT is used to replace traditional self-attention layers in Transformer architectures, reducing computational complexity by transforming data into the frequency domain for efficient convolution operations. This approach is selected for its ability to significantly reduce the number of floating-point operations required, thereby improving computational efficiency. The FFT is expected to maintain or enhance model performance by efficiently capturing relevant features of the input data, particularly in scenarios involving large sequences. The success of this variable will be measured by comparing the computational efficiency and accuracy of the FFT-based model against traditional Transformer models, using metrics such as FLOPs and F1 score.\nSparse Model Utilization: Sparse Model Utilization involves reducing the number of active parameters in the model by pruning less significant weights, which decreases memory usage and computation times. This approach is chosen for its potential to further enhance computational efficiency by minimizing the model's size and energy consumption. Sparse models are particularly relevant for deploying models on resource-constrained devices, as they reduce the carbon footprint associated with training large, dense models. The effectiveness of this variable will be assessed by measuring the model's memory usage and computation times, as well as its accuracy on NLP tasks, using metrics like F1 score and BLEU score.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating FFT and Sparse Model Utilization into a Transformer architecture. The FFT will be applied to replace traditional self-attention layers, transforming input data into the frequency domain for efficient convolution operations. This will involve using existing codeblocks for FFT implementation, ensuring that the data is transformed, processed, and then returned to the spatial domain using inverse FFT. Sparse Model Utilization will be achieved by implementing weight pruning techniques, setting weights below a certain threshold to zero, thereby reducing the number of active parameters. This will require building new codeblocks to handle the pruning process and efficiently manage sparse data structures. The data flow will involve input sequences being processed through FFT layers, followed by sparse model layers, and finally evaluated for accuracy and computational efficiency. The implementation will include setting up the Transformer architecture with FFT and sparse layers, configuring model parameters, and running experiments on NLP benchmark tasks to evaluate performance. The expected outputs will be the model's computational efficiency, measured in FLOPs, and accuracy, assessed using F1 and BLEU scores. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be computational efficiency, measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPs), and accuracy on NLP tasks, assessed using F1 and BLEU scores. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the performance of the FFT and sparse model-integrated Transformer against a baseline Transformer model without these modifications. The benchmark tasks will include standard NLP datasets, such as sentiment analysis and machine translation, to ensure comprehensive evaluation. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant reduction in FLOPs without a decrease in F1 and BLEU scores, indicating maintained or enhanced accuracy. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with success defined as achieving comparable or superior performance with reduced computational resources.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing a baseline Transformer architecture against an FFT-Sparse Transformer architecture on NLP tasks.

The Siamese network is employed to improve the retrieval process by learning a mapping between visual concepts and sentences, thereby enhancing the diversity and accuracy of the weakly-aligned corpus. Retrieval-augmented prompting is used to provide contextually relevant information during inference, leveraging external knowledge sources to improve the model's ability to generate accurate and context-aware responses. By combining these techniques, the research aims to address the limitations of current retrieval methods that often rely on detected object tags, which may lack diversity and coverage of visually grounded information. The hypothesis will be tested on benchmark datasets like MSCOCO, comparing the precision and recall of the integrated approach against a baseline using retrieval-augmented prompting alone. This study is expected to demonstrate that the combination of a Siamese network and retrieval-augmented prompting can significantly enhance cross-modal alignment performance, providing a more robust solution for tasks requiring detailed understanding of image-text relationships. \nKey Variables:\nSiamese Network for Better Retrieval: This variable represents the use of a Siamese network architecture to improve the retrieval process by learning a mapping between visual concepts and sentences. The network consists of two identical subnetworks that process image and text inputs separately, producing embeddings that can be compared to determine similarity. This approach is selected for its potential to enhance retrieval accuracy and diversity, addressing limitations in current methods that may not cover all visually grounded information. The Siamese network's effectiveness will be assessed by its ability to improve precision and recall in cross-modal alignment tasks on benchmark datasets.\nRetrieval-Augmented Prompting: This variable involves using a retrieval process to provide the model with contextually relevant information during inference. It enhances the model's ability to generate accurate and context-aware responses by incorporating external knowledge sources. Retrieval-augmented prompting is implemented by integrating a retrieval module that searches for relevant information based on the input prompt and incorporates it into the model's input. This approach is chosen for its effectiveness in tasks requiring access to external knowledge bases, and its impact will be measured by improvements in precision and recall in cross-modal alignment tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating a Siamese network for better retrieval with retrieval-augmented prompting. The Siamese network will be built using existing neural network libraries to create two identical subnetworks that process image and text inputs separately. These subnetworks will produce embeddings that can be compared to determine similarity, enhancing the retrieval accuracy and diversity of the weakly-aligned corpus. Retrieval-augmented prompting will be implemented by integrating a retrieval module that searches for relevant information based on the input prompt and incorporates it into the model's input. This module will leverage existing APIs for accessing external knowledge sources. The implementation will involve setting up the Siamese network to process image-text pairs from benchmark datasets like MSCOCO, and using retrieval-augmented prompting to provide additional context during inference. The data flow will involve feeding image-text pairs into the Siamese network to generate embeddings, using these embeddings to retrieve relevant information, and incorporating this information into the model's input for improved cross-modal alignment. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the precision and recall of the integrated approach against a baseline using retrieval-augmented prompting alone, with the expectation that the combination of techniques will yield superior performance. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision and recall, which measure the accuracy and completeness of the retrieval process, respectively. Precision will be calculated as the proportion of correctly retrieved image-text pairs over the total number of pairs retrieved, while recall will be assessed by the proportion of relevant pairs retrieved out of all relevant pairs available in the dataset. The hypothesis will be tested on benchmark datasets like MSCOCO, comparing the precision and recall of the integrated approach against a baseline using retrieval-augmented prompting alone. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in precision and recall, with multiple runs conducted to ensure robustness. Statistical confidence will be assessed using appropriate tests to validate the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether integrating a Siamese network with retrieval-augmented prompting improves cross-modal alignment performance. The experiment should be implemented as a pilot study with three possible settings (controlled by PILOT_MODE global variable):\n\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Use 50 image-text pairs from MSCOCO training set\n- Train Siamese network for 5 epochs\n- Test on 10 image-text pairs\n- Maximum 2 retrieved examples per query\n\nPILOT:\n- Use 500 image-text pairs from MSCOCO training set\n- Train Siamese network for 20 epochs\n- Test on 100 image-text pairs from dev set\n- Maximum 5 retrieved examples per query\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n- Use full MSCOCO training set\n- Train Siamese network for 100 epochs\n- Test on full test set\n- Maximum 10 retrieved examples per query\n\nImplementation Requirements:\n1.

For the Siamese network (experimental condition only):\n   - Create twin networks that encode image features and text separately\n   - Use cosine similarity loss\n   - Train on image-text pairs\n   - Save embeddings for retrieval\n\n2. For retrieval-augmented prompting (both conditions):\n   - Baseline: Use direct text similarity for retrieval\n   - Experimental: Use Siamese network embeddings for retrieval\n   - Format prompt template: 'Given the image [image_features], and these similar examples: [retrieved_examples], describe the relationship between the image and text [target_text].'\n\n3. Evaluation:\n   - Calculate precision (correct pairs / total retrieved)\n   - Calculate recall (correct pairs retrieved / total relevant pairs)\n   - Log all results including raw scores\n   - Create line plots showing precision/recall over epochs\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to compare baseline vs experimental\n\nRequired outputs:\n1. Training logs showing loss over epochs\n2. Precision/recall scores for both conditions\n3. Statistical comparison results\n4. Line plots of performance metrics\n5. Full trajectory of example retrievals\n\nPlease run MINI_PILOT first. If successful, run PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT for human verification.\n\nAll results should be logged using the logger, and any errors should be caught and logged appropriately.

Saliency maps will be used to visualize which parts of the input data most influence the model's predictions by highlighting the gradient of the output with respect to the input. SHAP, on the other hand, will provide a global view of feature importance by assigning each feature an importance value based on cooperative game theory. The 64-shot setting will provide the model with a substantial number of examples to learn from, enhancing its ability to generalize from minimal data. This combination is expected to improve interpretability by providing both local and global insights into the model's decision-making process, while also enhancing performance accuracy due to the enriched understanding of feature contributions. The research aims to fill the gap in existing literature by exploring this novel combination of techniques, which has not been extensively tested in similar studies. \nKey Variables:\nSaliency Maps: Saliency maps highlight the most important parts of the input data that influence the model's predictions by computing the gradient of the output with respect to the input. This visualization technique will be implemented using gradient-based methods in a neural network, such as a transformer model, to provide a visual representation of the model's decision-making process. The saliency maps will be used during model evaluation to identify which features are most influential in the model's predictions, providing insights into the model's focus and enhancing interpretability.\nSHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): SHAP is a feature attribution method that assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. It calculates the contribution of each feature by considering all possible combinations of features, providing a global view of feature importance. SHAP values will be computed using the SHAP library to interpret the model's predictions in the sentiment analysis task. This method will help in understanding complex models by providing a visual representation of feature importance, enhancing interpretability and trust in the model's predictions.\n64-shot setting: The 64-shot setting involves providing the model with 64 labeled examples within the prompt. This setting allows for a more robust training process compared to lower-shot settings, as it provides more data for the model to learn from. The implementation will involve manually designing prompts that effectively guide the model to leverage its inherent semantic understanding. This setting is crucial for scenarios where training samples are limited, allowing the model to generalize from minimal data and improve performance accuracy in sentiment analysis tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate saliency maps and SHAP feature attribution into a 64-shot prompt-based few-shot learning model for sentiment analysis tasks. The process will begin with setting up a transformer-based model, such as BERT, to perform sentiment analysis. Saliency maps will be generated by computing the gradient of the model's output with respect to the input features, using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. SHAP values will be calculated using the SHAP library, which requires training the model and then interpreting its predictions to determine feature importance. The 64-shot setting will be achieved by designing prompts that include 64 labeled examples, allowing the model to learn from a substantial amount of data. The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which will measure its ability to correctly classify sentiment while providing interpretable insights into its decision-making process. The integration of saliency maps and SHAP will be facilitated by building custom scripts to visualize and analyze the model's predictions, ensuring that both local and global interpretability are achieved. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which will measure the model's performance in correctly classifying sentiment. These metrics will be calculated by comparing the model's predictions to the true sentiment labels in a test dataset. Improvement will be interpreted as higher scores in these metrics compared to a baseline model without the integration of saliency maps and SHAP. The interpretability of the model will be assessed qualitatively by analyzing the saliency maps and SHAP values to determine how well they align with human reasoning in sentiment analysis. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical significance and reliability of the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing baseline and experimental few-shot sentiment analysis models. The experiment should have three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Use 10 examples from IMDB dataset training set\n- 64-shot learning setting (64 examples in prompt)\n- 3 evaluation runs per condition\n- Maximum 5 minutes runtime\n\nPILOT:\n- Use 100 examples from IMDB dataset training set\n- 64-shot learning setting\n- 10 evaluation runs per condition\n- Maximum 1 hour runtime\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n- Use full IMDB dataset (training/dev/test splits)\n- 64-shot learning setting\n- 25 evaluation runs per condition\n- No runtime restriction\n\nSpecific Requirements:\n1.

Semantic retrieval leverages deep learning models to understand the meaning of queries and documents, allowing for more accurate retrieval of relevant information. DyKnow, a dynamic benchmarking framework, continuously updates benchmark datasets to reflect real-time information, allowing for ongoing assessment of a model's factual accuracy. By integrating these two techniques, the research seeks to enhance the factual accuracy of LLMs by ensuring that they retrieve and utilize the most current and contextually relevant information. The hypothesis posits that this integration will lead to improved precision and recall compared to static models, which rely on fixed data snapshots and static benchmarks. The study will involve setting up a semantic retrieval system to fetch relevant documents based on input queries and using DyKnow to dynamically update the benchmark dataset with real-time data. The performance of the LLMs will be evaluated using precision and recall metrics, comparing the results to those of static models. The expected outcome is that the integration of semantic retrieval and dynamic benchmarking will result in higher precision and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing the factual accuracy of LLMs in real-time question answering scenarios. \nKey Variables:\nSemantic Retrieval: Semantic retrieval involves using deep learning models like BERT or GPT to encode queries and documents into a semantic space, allowing for the retrieval of semantically similar documents. This technique improves retrieval accuracy by understanding the meaning of queries and documents, rather than relying solely on keyword matching. In this research, semantic retrieval will be implemented by fine-tuning a model on a specific dataset to enhance retrieval accuracy. The expected role of semantic retrieval is to provide contextually accurate information that informs the LLM's responses, directly influencing the precision and recall metrics. The retrieval system will be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to assess its effectiveness in retrieving relevant documents.\nDynamic Benchmarking with DyKnow: Dynamic benchmarking with DyKnow involves continuously updating benchmark datasets to reflect real-time information, allowing for ongoing assessment of a model's factual accuracy. This process requires setting up a pipeline that regularly pulls data from sources like Wikidata to update the benchmark. The model's performance is then evaluated against this dynamic benchmark, providing insights into its ability to handle time-sensitive information. In this research, DyKnow will be used to dynamically update the benchmark dataset with real-time data, ensuring that the LLM's responses are evaluated against the most current information. The effectiveness of DyKnow will be assessed using precision and recall metrics, with the expectation that it will enhance the LLM's ability to retrieve accurate information in real-time scenarios.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities, leveraging existing codeblocks for semantic retrieval and dynamic benchmarking. The semantic retrieval component will be implemented using a pre-trained BERT or GPT model, fine-tuned on a specific dataset to enhance retrieval accuracy. This model will encode queries and documents into a semantic space, allowing for the retrieval of semantically similar documents. The retrieved documents will then be used to inform the LLM's responses. For dynamic benchmarking, DyKnow will be set up to continuously update the benchmark dataset with real-time data from sources like Wikidata. This will involve configuring a pipeline that regularly fetches and integrates new data into the benchmark framework. The LLM's performance will be evaluated using precision and recall metrics, comparing the results to those of static models. The implementation will involve setting up the semantic retrieval system, configuring DyKnow for dynamic benchmarking, and integrating these components with the LLM to assess its performance in real-time question answering applications. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision and recall. Precision measures the proportion of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while recall measures the ability to retrieve all relevant instances from the dataset. These metrics will be used to assess the factual accuracy of the LLM's responses in real-time question answering applications. The benchmark tasks will involve real-time data updates from sources like Wikidata, with the LLM's performance compared to that of static models. Improvement will be interpreted as higher precision and recall values for the LLM with integrated semantic retrieval and dynamic benchmarking compared to the static models. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether semantic retrieval with dynamic knowledge updating improves LLM question answering performance. The experiment should have three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Use 10 questions from TriviaQA dataset (from Huggingface)\n- Create two conditions:\n  1.

Dynamic Task Allocation optimizes resource distribution among agents based on real-time needs, ensuring tasks are assigned to the most capable agents, thereby reducing idle time and improving efficiency. Communicative Dehallucination encourages agents to engage in multi-turn dialogues to clarify task requirements, minimizing misunderstandings and errors. By combining these techniques, the research aims to address the limitations of static task allocation and immediate responses, which often lead to inefficiencies and errors in complex software development environments. The expected outcome is a more efficient and accurate multi-agent system, capable of handling dynamic workloads and complex task requirements with reduced error rates and faster completion times. This approach leverages the strengths of LLMs in managing complex workflows and enhances the speed of task execution by minimizing bottlenecks and ensuring continuous progress through effective agent collaboration. \nKey Variables:\nDynamic Task Allocation: Dynamic Task Allocation involves using LLMs as orchestrators to optimize task distribution among agents based on real-time needs. This method compares task allocations against the Hungarian Algorithm to ensure optimal solutions. By dynamically allocating resources and adjusting task assignments based on agent capabilities, this approach enhances efficiency and reduces task completion time. The planner method, which outperforms the orchestrator method in handling concurrent actions, is particularly effective in utilizing agents with fewer idle actions. This strategy is crucial for improving performance in multi-agent systems where task demands and agent capabilities vary over time.\nCommunicative Dehallucination: Communicative Dehallucination is a technique used within the ChatDev framework to reduce communication errors by encouraging agents to seek further details about tasks over multiple turns, rather than responding immediately. This method involves a structured dialogue process where the assistant agent is prompted to ask clarifying questions, ensuring a deeper understanding of the task requirements before proceeding. This iterative communication strategy helps in minimizing misunderstandings and incorrect task executions by allowing agents to refine their understanding through dialogue. The implementation leverages LLMs to manage these multi-turn interactions, using context-rich prompts to guide the conversation. This approach is particularly useful in complex software development tasks where precise communication is critical to task success.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for LLM-based task allocation and communication management. Dynamic Task Allocation will be implemented by adapting the planner method to dynamically assign tasks based on agent capabilities and workload, using a task queue system. Communicative Dehallucination will be integrated by implementing a multi-turn dialogue system that prompts agents to seek clarifications before task execution. The system will use LLMs to facilitate these dialogues, ensuring context-rich interactions. Data will flow between components through a task management module that coordinates task assignments and communication exchanges. New logic will be built to integrate these components, ensuring seamless interaction and data flow. The setup will involve configuring the LLMs for task allocation and communication, defining task queues, and implementing dialogue prompts. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing task completion times and communication error rates with a baseline system lacking these integrations. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be task completion time and communication error rate. Task completion time will be measured as the total time taken to complete a set of predefined software development tasks. Communication error rate will be assessed by the number of misunderstandings or incorrect task executions observed during the process. The hypothesis will be tested using a benchmark set of software development tasks, with a control condition consisting of the existing ChatDev framework without the integrated techniques. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant reduction in task completion time and communication error rate compared to the control condition. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure reliability, with statistical analysis to confirm significance.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether integrating Dynamic Task Allocation and Communicative Dehallucination improves task completion time and reduces communication errors in simulated software development tasks.

The hypothesis posits that combining structured pruning, which simplifies model complexity by removing entire structures such as neurons or layers, with the fine-tuning of expert and anti-expert models, which adjusts the base model's parameters based on clean and noisy data subsets, will lead to a reduction in non-factual hallucinations. The XSUM dataset, known for its challenging single-sentence summaries, will serve as the evaluation benchmark. The expected outcome is a significant reduction in non-factual hallucinations, as measured by entity-level factuality classification, while maintaining or improving ROUGE scores. This approach leverages the strengths of structured pruning in simplifying model decision-making and the precision of expert and anti-expert fine-tuning in steering model learning towards factual consistency. By addressing the limitations of each technique when used in isolation, this integration aims to enhance the factual reliability of generated summaries. \nKey Variables:\nStructured Pruning: Structured pruning removes entire structures such as neurons, layers, or attention heads from a model, reducing complexity while maintaining task performance. In this experiment, structured pruning will be applied to the base summarization model to simplify its architecture, making it more reliant on input data for generating summaries. This technique is expected to reduce non-factual hallucinations by focusing the model's decision-making on relevant input features. The effectiveness of structured pruning will be assessed by comparing the factuality and ROUGE scores of summaries generated before and after pruning.\nExpert and Anti-expert Model Fine-tuning: This technique involves fine-tuning a base summarization model on two distinct data subsets: a clean subset for the expert model and a noisy subset for the anti-expert model. The parameter differences between these models are used to adjust the base model, steering it towards the expert model's parameter space. This process aims to enhance the model's factual consistency by focusing learning on reliable data. In this experiment, the fine-tuning process will be applied to the XSUM dataset, and its impact on reducing non-factual hallucinations will be evaluated using entity-level factuality classification metrics.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities, leveraging existing codeblocks for model fine-tuning and structured pruning. The experiment will begin with the selection of clean and noisy data subsets from the XSUM dataset, using automatic factual metrics to guide the selection process. The base summarization model will undergo structured pruning, removing entire structures such as neurons or layers to simplify its architecture. Following pruning, the model will be fine-tuned using the expert and anti-expert approach. This involves training the expert model on the clean subset and the anti-expert model on the noisy subset, then adjusting the base model's parameters based on the differences between these models. The integration of structured pruning with expert and anti-expert fine-tuning aims to enhance the model's factual consistency by reducing non-factual hallucinations. The effectiveness of this approach will be evaluated using entity-level factuality classification metrics and ROUGE scores, comparing the performance of the pruned and fine-tuned model against a baseline model without pruning. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is entity-level factuality classification, which measures the factual consistency of entities in the generated summaries with the source document. This metric will be calculated using pre-trained and fine-tuned masked language models to assess the likelihood of entities being correctly inferred from the source text. The secondary metric is ROUGE scores, which evaluate the informativeness of the summaries by measuring n-gram overlap with reference summaries. Success will be determined by a significant reduction in non-factual hallucinations, as indicated by improved entity-level factuality classification, without a degradation in ROUGE scores. The experiment will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment to test whether integrating structured pruning with expert and anti-expert fine-tuning reduces non-factual hallucinations in abstractive summarization. The experiment should have three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) defined as a global variable.\n\nDataset and Models:\n1. Use the XSUM dataset from Huggingface Hub\n2.

Diachronic embedding divides entity representation into dynamic and static parts, allowing the model to capture temporal characteristics effectively. The neural time point process model leverages attention mechanisms and relational continuous time-coding functions to capture temporally adjacent entity relationship characteristics. By combining these two approaches, the research aims to improve the model's ability to handle previously unseen entities and predict future events accurately. The expected outcome is an enhanced forecasting accuracy, measured by Hits@3 and MRR, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in capturing temporal dynamics and structural information in TKGs. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods, which often struggle with modeling temporal patterns and handling new entities, by providing a comprehensive framework that leverages both temporal and relational patterns. \nKey Variables:\nDiachronic Embedding: Diachronic embedding involves dividing the representation of an entity into dynamic and static parts. The dynamic part changes with the evolution of events, while the static part retains the fixed attributes of the entity. This method integrates the time of events into dynamic learning, represented as solid circles of different colors in the model's visualization. The proportion of temporal features is a hyperparameter ranging from 0 to 1, which determines how much of the entity's representation is dedicated to capturing temporal characteristics. This approach allows the model to learn different states of entities at different times, enhancing the ability to make accurate predictions.\nNeural Time Point Process Model: This model uses a neural time point process to learn entity and relational representations. The approach leverages the attention mechanism and relational continuous time-coding function to capture temporally adjacent entity relationship characteristics. An adaptive time gate network structure is adopted, enabling the model to transmit and update entity information at different time steps. This method flexibly captures feature dependency relationships between entities, enhancing the model's entity prediction performance in temporal knowledge graphs.\nForecasting Accuracy Metrics: The primary metrics used to evaluate the hypothesis are Hits@3 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Hits@3 measures the proportion of times the correct entity is ranked within the top three predictions, while MRR evaluates how well the model ranks the correct future event among its predictions. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's ranking capabilities and are commonly used in information retrieval and recommendation systems.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities, integrating diachronic embedding with a neural time point process model. The diachronic embedding will be configured to divide entity representations into dynamic and static parts, with a hyperparameter controlling the proportion of temporal features. The neural time point process model will be implemented using existing code for attention mechanisms and relational continuous time-coding functions. Data will flow from the diachronic embedding module to the neural time point process model, where entity and relational representations will be updated over time. The model will be tested on a temporal knowledge graph dataset, such as ICEWS, to evaluate its performance in handling previously unseen entities. The implementation will involve setting up the diachronic embedding and neural time point process model, configuring the hyperparameters, and running experiments to measure Hits@3 and MRR. The results will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the integration in improving forecasting accuracy. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are Hits@3 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Hits@3 measures the model's ability to rank the correct entity within the top three predictions, providing a lenient measure of accuracy. MRR evaluates the effectiveness of the model in predicting the rank of the correct answer, offering a comprehensive view of the model's ranking capabilities. The hypothesis will be tested using a temporal knowledge graph dataset, such as ICEWS, with a control condition using a baseline model without the integration of diachronic embedding and neural time point process model. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher Hits@3 and MRR compared to the baseline, with statistical confidence determined through multiple runs.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing a baseline neural time point process model against an experimental condition that integrates diachronic embedding with the neural time point process model, for temporal knowledge graph forecasting. The experiment should follow these specifications:\n\n1. Dataset:\n- Use the Huggingface Datasets API to load the ICEWS (Integrated Crisis Early Warning System) dataset\n- The dataset should be split into train/dev/test sets (0.7/0.15/0.15)\n\n2.

The hypothesis is that this combination will reduce the performance gap, resulting in more balanced accuracy across varying term frequencies. Context augmentation involves providing additional context during finetuning, which helps the model make more informed predictions by integrating relevant contextual information into the training data. Random word removal increases dataset diversity by selectively omitting words, encouraging the model to generalize better by exposing it to a wider range of sentence structures. This combination is expected to mitigate the impact of term frequency biases, as context augmentation provides a richer learning environment, while random word removal prevents overfitting to specific term frequencies. The expected outcome is a reduction in the performance gap, indicating improved generalization capabilities of the model. This research addresses the limitations of prior work by focusing on a novel combination of techniques that have not been extensively explored together, providing a promising direction for enhancing few-shot numerical reasoning tasks. \nKey Variables:\nPretraining Strategy: GPT-based models pretrained on the Pile dataset. This strategy involves using language models that have been pretrained on a large, diverse dataset designed to improve generalization capabilities. The Pile dataset includes a mix of different text sources, allowing the model to encounter a broad spectrum of term frequencies during training. This exposure helps the model generalize better to tasks involving less frequent terms by relying more on reasoning capabilities rather than memorization.\nFinetuning with Context Augmentation: This involves adapting a pretrained model by introducing additional context during the finetuning phase. Relevant contextual information is appended to the input data, which helps the model make more informed predictions. This strategy is particularly effective when the model's initial pretraining did not include sufficient examples of certain term frequencies, as it allows the model to adjust its understanding based on new, context-rich data.\nRandom Word Removal: A data augmentation technique that involves selectively omitting words from sentences in the training data to increase the diversity and robustness of the dataset. This approach helps the model generalize better by exposing it to a wider range of sentence structures and vocabulary distributions, thereby reducing overfitting to specific term frequencies.\nPerformance Gap: Measured by comparing model accuracy on instances with the most frequent terms versus those with the least frequent terms in the pretraining data. This metric provides insight into how much the model's performance is biased towards frequent terms, indicating a lack of generalization.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging its Experiment Builder to create, run, and debug the experiment code. The implementation will involve using GPT-based models pretrained on the Pile dataset as the baseline. Finetuning with context augmentation will be applied by appending additional context to the input data during the finetuning phase. Random word removal will be implemented by setting a probability threshold for word removal, ensuring that not all words are removed, which maintains the sentence's overall meaning. The performance gap will be measured by comparing model accuracy on instances with the most frequent terms versus those with the least frequent terms in the pretraining data. The experiment will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical significance, and the results will be analyzed to determine the impact of the combined techniques on the performance gap. The CodeScientist system will automate the process of creating, running, and analyzing the experiments, providing a comprehensive report on the results. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric will be the performance gap, measured by comparing model accuracy on instances with the most frequent terms versus those with the least frequent terms. Secondary metrics will include overall model accuracy and the standard deviation of accuracy across varying term frequencies. The hypothesis will be tested using benchmark tasks from the few-shot numerical reasoning domain, with control conditions including models without context augmentation and random word removal. Improvement will be interpreted as a reduction in the performance gap and a more balanced accuracy across term frequencies. Statistical significance will be assessed using standard tests, and multiple runs will be conducted to ensure robustness.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate whether combining context augmentation and random word removal during finetuning can reduce performance gaps in few-shot numerical reasoning.

The Interactive User Feedback System allows users to provide real-time feedback on test examples, which can adjust prediction rationales and reduce bias in explanations while maintaining prediction accuracy. FairFil, a task-agnostic debiasing method, filters biased information from sentence representations without altering the model's parameters. By combining these methods, the hypothesis posits that user feedback can dynamically enhance FairFil's static debiasing capabilities, leading to superior bias mitigation and sustained language model performance. This approach addresses the limitations of static debiasing methods by incorporating real-time user input, potentially resulting in more nuanced and adaptable bias reduction. The expected outcome is a more effective bias mitigation strategy that maintains the integrity of language model performance, as evaluated through intrinsic bias benchmarks like SEAT and task performance metrics such as accuracy and F1 score. \nKey Variables:\nInteractive User Feedback System: This system involves users interacting with test examples to provide feedback that can adjust prediction rationales at test time. It allows for a subjective and fair balance between task performance and bias mitigation. The system uses a frozen predictive model where users can decrease bias in explanations while maintaining prediction accuracy. It is implemented to simulate a feedback loop that dynamically adjusts model outputs, enhancing bias mitigation effectiveness.\nFairFil: FairFil is a task-agnostic debiasing method that operates post-hoc, filtering biased information from sentence representations without altering pre-trained language model parameters. It targets demographic biases and is evaluated using bias-neutralizing loss functions and intrinsic bias benchmarks. FairFil's effectiveness lies in its ability to maintain model performance while reducing bias, making it a suitable baseline for comparison with dynamic debiasing methods.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate an Interactive User Feedback System with FairFil. The Interactive User Feedback System will be adapted to allow real-time user interactions with test examples, providing feedback that adjusts prediction rationales. This system will be built using existing codeblocks for user interaction and feedback processing, with additional logic to integrate feedback into the model's output adjustments. FairFil will be implemented using its existing framework to filter biased components from sentence representations. The integration will involve developing a glue module that combines user feedback with FairFil's debiasing process, ensuring that feedback dynamically influences the debiasing outcomes. Data will flow from user interactions to the feedback processing module, which will then adjust the model's outputs in conjunction with FairFil's static debiasing. The hypothesis will be realized by running experiments on benchmark datasets, measuring bias mitigation effectiveness and task performance using intrinsic bias benchmarks and task performance metrics. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are bias mitigation effectiveness and language model performance. Bias mitigation will be assessed using intrinsic bias benchmarks like the Sentence Encoder Association Test (SEAT), which measures the presence of biases in model outputs. Language model performance will be evaluated using task performance metrics such as accuracy and F1 score on benchmark datasets. The control condition will involve using FairFil alone, while the experimental condition will integrate the Interactive User Feedback System with FairFil. Improvement will be interpreted as a reduction in bias scores and maintenance or improvement in task performance metrics compared to the control condition. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing FairFil debiasing alone (baseline) versus FairFil with Interactive User Feedback (experimental) for bias mitigation in language models.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Dynamic Multilingual Prompting\nShort Description: Combining Chain-of-Thought prompting with syntax adaptation to enhance multilingual QA performance.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating Chain-of-Thought prompting with syntax complexity adaptation will enhance LLM performance on multilingual QA tasks, as measured by accuracy and F1 score, more effectively than static cross-lingual-thought prompting.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating Chain-of-Thought prompting with syntax complexity adaptation\nDependent variable: LLM performance on multilingual QA tasks\nComparison groups: Chain-of-Thought prompting with syntax complexity adaptation vs. static cross-lingual-thought prompting\nBaseline/control: Static cross-lingual-thought prompting\nContext/setting: Multilingual QA tasks\nAssumptions: Syntax complexity adaptation and Chain-of-Thought prompting can be effectively integrated\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: LLM systems\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Accuracy and F1 score\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the hypothesis that combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with syntax complexity adaptation will improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on multilingual question answering (QA) tasks. Chain-of-Thought prompting guides the model through a series of reasoning steps, enhancing its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks across languages. Syntax complexity adaptation involves tailoring prompts to match the syntactic intricacy of the target language, ensuring that the model can process and generate language appropriately. By integrating these two techniques, the research aims to leverage the strengths of CoT's structured reasoning and syntax adaptation's linguistic alignment to outperform static cross-lingual-thought prompting. This approach addresses the limitations of static prompting by dynamically adjusting to linguistic characteristics, potentially leading to higher accuracy and F1 scores on multilingual QA benchmarks. The expected outcome is a more robust multilingual model capable of handling diverse linguistic inputs with improved reasoning and syntactic alignment. \nKey Variables:\nChain-of-Thought Prompting: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting involves guiding the LLM through a series of reasoning steps to arrive at a conclusion. This technique enhances the model's ability to perform complex reasoning tasks by breaking down the problem into manageable parts. CoT prompting is implemented by providing the model with structured prompts that include intermediate reasoning steps. This approach is particularly effective in multilingual scenarios, where it leverages the model's inherent multilingual capabilities without modifying its parameters during inference. The expected role of CoT prompting in this research is to improve the model's reasoning accuracy and response consistency across different languages.\nSyntax Complexity Adaptation: Syntax complexity adaptation involves tailoring prompts to match the syntactic intricacy of the target language. This is achieved by analyzing the syntactic structure of sentences and adjusting prompts to align with the language's syntax. The implementation includes using syntactic parsers to calculate metrics such as average parse tree depth and the frequency of complex syntactic structures. By aligning prompts with the syntactic characteristics of the target language, this approach enhances the model's ability to process and generate language that is syntactically appropriate for the task. The expected outcome is improved performance on multilingual QA tasks by ensuring that the model can handle syntactic variations across languages.\n\nImplementation: The implementation of this hypothesis will involve using the CodeScientist system to integrate Chain-of-Thought prompting with syntax complexity adaptation for multilingual QA tasks. The process begins with the selection of a multilingual QA benchmark, such as MKQA, to evaluate the model's performance. The Chain-of-Thought prompting will be implemented using existing codeblocks that guide the model through a series of reasoning steps. Syntax complexity adaptation will be achieved by analyzing the syntactic structure of the input language using syntactic parsers and adjusting the prompts accordingly. The CodeScientist system will automate the experiment setup, execution, and analysis, leveraging its Experiment Builder to create, run, and debug the experiment code. The system will conduct multiple independent attempts to ensure robustness and reliability of the results. The integration of CoT prompting and syntax adaptation will be tested against a baseline of static cross-lingual-thought prompting to evaluate improvements in accuracy and F1 score. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be accuracy and F1 score on the selected multilingual QA benchmark, such as MKQA. Accuracy will measure the proportion of correct predictions made by the model, while the F1 score will provide a balance between precision and recall, offering a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the performance of the integrated CoT prompting and syntax adaptation against a baseline of static cross-lingual-thought prompting. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in accuracy and F1 score across multiple runs, with confidence intervals calculated to assess the reliability of the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with syntax complexity adaptation improves multilingual QA performance compared to static cross-lingual prompting. The experiment should be implemented as a pilot study with three possible modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) defined as a global variable.\n\nDataset:\n1.

Calculate for each condition:\n   - Accuracy (exact match)\n   - F1 score (partial match)\n2. Use bootstrap resampling to compare conditions\n3. Report results per language and overall\n\nLogging Requirements:\n1. Log all LLM calls (prompts and responses)\n2. Log syntax complexity metrics\n3. Log performance metrics\n4. Generate summary statistics\n\nExecution Flow:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT\n3. Stop after PILOT (await human verification before FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. CSV file with per-question results\n2. Summary statistics per condition\n3. Bootstrap comparison results\n4. Detailed logs of all operations\n\nError Handling:\n1. Implement robust error handling for LLM calls\n2. Handle missing or malformed data\n3. Log all errors comprehensively \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1. A report, describing the results of your research.

The hypothesis posits that this combination will lead to more accurate BLEU and ROUGE scores, reflecting the model's true capabilities. The CONSTAT framework's statistical contamination test is paired with N-gram Overlap Detection to identify and mitigate data contamination, which is a common issue in large language models like GPT-4. By applying this method to the British National Corpus and Deutsches Textarchiv, the study aims to ensure that the evaluation metrics are not artificially inflated due to prior exposure to similar data during training. This approach addresses gaps in current literature by combining statistical and overlap-based contamination detection methods, providing a comprehensive evaluation of model performance. The expected outcome is a more reliable assessment of GPT-4's ability to process and generate historical texts, contributing to the field of NLP by enhancing the validity of evaluation metrics. \nKey Variables:\nNLP Model: GPT-4 is selected for its advanced capabilities and risk of data contamination due to extensive training datasets. It will be evaluated using the CONSTAT framework with N-gram Overlap Detection to ensure performance metrics reflect true capabilities rather than inflated results from training on evaluation data.\nCONSTAT Framework: The Statistical Contamination Test within the CONSTAT framework is used to detect discrepancies in model performance on contaminated versus reference benchmarks. This method is robust against evasion attacks and provides a principled approach to contamination detection.\nData Contamination Detection: N-gram Overlap Detection is employed to identify overlaps between training and evaluation datasets. This method is computationally efficient and helps ensure that performance metrics are not skewed by prior exposure to test data.\nBLEU and ROUGE Scores: These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance on the British National Corpus and Deutsches Textarchiv. BLEU measures n-gram precision, while ROUGE assesses n-gram recall and longest common subsequence, providing a comprehensive evaluation of text generation quality.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for the CONSTAT framework and N-gram Overlap Detection. The process begins with loading GPT-4 and the British National Corpus and Deutsches Textarchiv datasets. The CONSTAT framework's statistical test will be applied to compare GPT-4's performance on original and reference benchmarks, identifying significant discrepancies indicative of contamination. N-gram Overlap Detection will be used to examine overlaps between training and evaluation datasets, setting thresholds for overlap detection. The BLEU and ROUGE scores will be calculated using existing codeblocks, with results compared to baseline evaluations without contamination detection. Data flows from the model output through contamination detection modules to the evaluation metrics, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of performance. Any new logic required for integration, such as data preprocessing or result aggregation, will be built as glue modules. The setup includes configuring the model and datasets, running contamination detection, and evaluating performance metrics, all automated within the CodeScientist framework. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics are BLEU and ROUGE scores, measuring n-gram precision and recall, respectively. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing these scores on the British National Corpus and Deutsches Textarchiv with and without contamination detection. The control condition is GPT-4 evaluated without the CONSTAT framework and N-gram Overlap Detection. Improvement is interpreted as a reduction in inflated scores, indicating more accurate reflection of true capabilities. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with success indicated by consistently lower scores in the contamination-detected setup compared to the baseline.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate gpt-4o-mini's performance on historical text generation using N-gram overlap detection and CONSTAT framework. The experiment should have the following components:\n\n1. PILOT_MODE Settings:\n   - MINI_PILOT: Use 10 text samples from each corpus (British National Corpus and Deutsches Textarchiv)\n   - PILOT: Use 100 text samples from each corpus\n   - FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use the complete corpora\n\n2. Dataset Preparation:\n   - Use the Huggingface Datasets API to load samples from British National Corpus and Deutsches Textarchiv\n   - For each text sample, create a prompt that asks gpt-4o-mini to generate a similar historical text\n   - Store original texts and generated texts for evaluation\n\n3. Experimental Conditions:\n   - Baseline: Direct evaluation using BLEU and ROUGE scores without contamination detection\n   - Experimental: Evaluation using CONSTAT framework with N-gram Overlap Detection\n\n4. N-gram Analysis:\n   - Use NLTK to generate n-grams (n=1,2,3,4) for both original and generated texts\n   - Implement overlap detection by comparing n-grams between training data and generated outputs\n   - Set overlap threshold at 0.3 (flag as contaminated if more than 30% of n-grams overlap)\n\n5. CONSTAT Framework Implementation:\n   - Calculate performance metrics (BLEU/ROUGE) on original benchmark\n   - Calculate performance metrics on reference benchmark (created by shuffling original texts)\n   - Compare distributions using statistical tests\n   - Flag texts as potentially contaminated if statistical difference is significant (p < 0.05)\n\n6. Evaluation Process:\n   - For each text sample:\n     a. Generate text using gpt-4o-mini\n     b. Calculate baseline BLEU and ROUGE scores\n     c. Perform N-gram overlap detection\n     d. Apply CONSTAT framework\n     e. Calculate adjusted BLEU and ROUGE scores (for samples not flagged as contaminated)\n\n7. Analysis:\n   - Compare baseline vs experimental scores using bootstrap resampling\n   - Report:\n     * Percentage of texts flagged as contaminated\n     * Mean and standard deviation of scores for both conditions\n     * Statistical significance of differences\n     * Effect size of the differences\n\n8. Output Requirements:\n   - Log all major steps and decisions\n   - Generate a results file with all metrics\n   - Include example texts that were flagged vs not flagged\n\nPlease implement this experiment starting with MINI_PILOT mode. After successful completion and verification, proceed to PILOT mode. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT mode for human verification.\n\nNote: Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls as specified in the special conditioning instructions. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

The dual-stream model processes natural language queries and molecular data in separate streams, each employing a dedicated neural network to encode its respective data type into a shared representation space. By incorporating adaptive attention weights, the model dynamically adjusts its focus on relevant features, enhancing interpretability and performance. This approach is expected to improve the alignment between textual queries and molecular features, leading to higher precision and recall in retrieval tasks. The motivation behind this research is to address the limitations of static attention mechanisms, which may not adequately capture the dynamic nature of cross-modal data. The expected outcome is a more robust retrieval system that can effectively handle diverse data characteristics, improving retrieval accuracy and user satisfaction. This study fills a gap in existing literature by exploring the novel combination of adaptive attention weights with dual-stream models, which has not been extensively covered in prior research. \nKey Variables:\nAdaptive Attention Weights: Adaptive attention weights dynamically adjust attention scores based on input data or task requirements. This flexibility allows the model to tailor its focus to the most relevant features, improving interpretability and performance. Implemented by incorporating additional layers or mechanisms, adaptive attention weights are particularly useful in dynamic environments where input data characteristics may vary. In this research, adaptive attention weights will be used to enhance the dual-stream model's ability to align textual queries with molecular features, improving retrieval accuracy.\nDual-Stream Model: The dual-stream model processes natural language and molecular data in separate streams before integrating them. Each stream uses a dedicated neural network to encode its respective data type into a shared representation space. This architecture facilitates the retrieval of molecular features that best match the semantic content of the query. In this research, the dual-stream model will be enhanced with adaptive attention weights to improve the alignment between textual queries and molecular features, leading to higher precision and recall.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating adaptive attention weights into a dual-stream model for cross-modal text-to-molecule retrieval. The dual-stream model will be constructed using existing neural network architectures, such as BERT for text processing and a graph neural network for molecular data. Adaptive attention weights will be implemented by adding layers that adjust attention scores dynamically based on input characteristics. The model will be trained on a dataset containing paired examples of text and molecular data, ensuring that it learns to capture the necessary relationships between these modalities. The training process will involve optimizing the model to maximize the alignment between textual queries and molecular features, using metrics such as precision and recall to evaluate performance. The implementation will require building new codeblocks for adaptive attention mechanisms and integrating them with the dual-stream model. Data flow will involve processing text and molecular data through separate streams, applying adaptive attention weights, and combining the outputs to generate a shared representation space. The hypothesis will be realized end-to-end in code by configuring the model, setting up the training environment, and evaluating the results using predefined metrics. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision and recall, which measure the proportion of relevant instances among the retrieved instances and the proportion of relevant instances retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances available, respectively. The model's performance will be tested using a benchmark dataset containing paired examples of text and molecular data. The control condition will involve a baseline dual-stream model without adaptive attention weights. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in precision and recall compared to the baseline. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and qualitative evaluations will be derived from analyzing the model's attention weights to understand its focus on relevant features.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing a baseline dual-stream model against an experimental dual-stream model with adaptive attention for text-to-molecule retrieval.

The study aims to compare the effectiveness of anticipatory prompts against heuristic prompts, focusing on precision and recall as key performance metrics. Anticipatory prompts are designed to guide the model by setting expectations for the type of response required, which is particularly useful in tasks that require the model to predict or infer information based on given data. This approach is hypothesized to improve the model's ability to align its outputs with the desired task outcome, thereby enhancing precision and recall. The research will utilize GPT-3.5, a state-of-the-art language model, to perform adverse event detection, a task critical for monitoring patient safety and improving treatment outcomes. By leveraging anticipatory prompts, the study seeks to address the limitations of heuristic prompts, which, while effective, may not provide the nuanced guidance needed for complex tasks like adverse event detection. The expected outcome is that anticipatory prompts will lead to a significant improvement in the precision and recall of GPT-3.5 compared to heuristic prompts, providing a more robust method for clinical NLP tasks. \nKey Variables:\nPrompt Engineering Technique: Anticipatory Prompts\nModel Type: GPT-3.5\nTask Type: Adverse Event Detection\nPerformance Metrics: Precision and Recall\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system. The experiment will involve setting up GPT-3.5 to perform adverse event detection using two types of prompts: anticipatory and heuristic. The anticipatory prompts will be crafted to set expectations for the model's outputs, guiding it to predict or infer relevant adverse events from clinical texts. In contrast, heuristic prompts will follow a rule-based approach, providing definitions or examples to guide the model. The codeblocks will include modules for loading and processing clinical text datasets, applying the different prompt types, and evaluating the model's performance in terms of precision and recall. Data will flow from the input clinical texts through the prompt application modules to the output evaluation modules. New logic will be built to integrate anticipatory prompts into the existing framework, ensuring that the model's outputs align with the task's desired outcomes. The setup will involve configuring GPT-3.5 with the appropriate API calls, specifying input/output formats, and defining evaluation criteria. The end-to-end process will be automated using the Experiment Builder, which will handle the execution and debugging of the experiment code. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision and recall. Precision will measure the proportion of correctly identified adverse events out of all events identified by the model, while recall will measure the proportion of actual adverse events that were correctly identified. The experiment will involve comparing the performance of GPT-3.5 using anticipatory prompts against heuristic prompts. The control condition will be the model's performance with heuristic prompts. Success will be interpreted as a statistically significant improvement in both precision and recall when using anticipatory prompts. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and results will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of anticipatory prompts in enhancing the model's performance in adverse event detection.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of anticipatory prompts versus heuristic prompts in adverse event detection from clinical texts. The experiment should use gpt-4o-mini (not GPT-3.5) as the base model.\n\nPILOT EXPERIMENT STRUCTURE:\nThe experiment should include a global PILOT_MODE variable that can be set to 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'. The settings should work as follows:\n- MINI_PILOT: Process 10 clinical texts, 5 known to contain adverse events and 5 without\n- PILOT: Process 100 clinical texts, 50 with adverse events and 50 without\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Process the full dataset\n\nDATASET:\n1. Use the Huggingface Hub API to search for and download an appropriate clinical text dataset containing adverse event annotations. If multiple datasets are found, prefer ones that are already labeled for adverse events.\n2. The dataset should be split into train/dev/test sets (60/20/20 split if not already split).\n3. For MINI_PILOT and PILOT modes, only use samples from the training set.\n\nPROMPT IMPLEMENTATIONS:\n1. Heuristic Prompts (Baseline):\n   - Use a template like: \"Given the following clinical text, identify any adverse events. An adverse event is [definition].

Anticipatory Prompts (Experimental):\n   - Use a template that sets expectations: \"You will analyze a clinical text for adverse events. Before you see the text, understand that you should:\n     1. Look for unexpected negative patient outcomes\n     2. Consider timing relationships between treatments and symptoms\n     3. Focus on causal relationships\n     4. Structure your response as a list of [event, timing, severity]\n   Now, here is the text: [text]\"\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nBoth conditions should output JSON in the following format:\n{\n    \"adverse_events\": [\n        {\n            \"event\": \"description of event\",\n            \"timing\": \"when it occurred\",\n            \"severity\": \"severity assessment\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nEVALUATION:\n1. Calculate precision and recall for each condition by comparing the detected adverse events against the ground truth annotations.\n2. Use bootstrap resampling to determine if differences between conditions are statistically significant.\n3. Generate a plot showing precision and recall for both conditions.\n\nEXPERIMENT FLOW:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT mode\n3. Stop after PILOT mode - do not proceed to FULL_EXPERIMENT (this requires manual verification)\n\nLOGGING AND REPORTING:\n1. Log all LLM calls, responses, and evaluation metrics\n2. For each pilot mode, generate a summary report including:\n   - Average precision and recall for each condition\n   - Bootstrap resampling results\n   - Statistical significance of differences\n   - Plot of precision/recall results\n   - Any error cases or unexpected behaviors\n\nPlease implement this experiment using the specified codeblocks, and ensure proper error handling and logging throughout. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Syntactic Diversity in ICL\nShort Description: Explores the impact of syntactic diversity and structured format on ICL accuracy in summarization.\nHypothesis to explore: Using six demonstrations with high syntactic diversity and a structured sequence format significantly improves the accuracy of in-context learning in text summarization tasks compared to using fewer demonstrations or lower diversity.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Number of demonstrations, syntactic diversity, structured sequence format\nDependent variable: Accuracy of in-context learning in text summarization tasks\nComparison groups: Six demonstrations with high syntactic diversity and structured sequence format vs. fewer demonstrations or lower diversity\nBaseline/control: Fewer demonstrations or lower diversity\nContext/setting: Text summarization tasks\nAssumptions: The structured sequence format and syntactic diversity are relevant to the task\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not specified\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Accuracy measurement in text summarization tasks\n\nLong Description: Description: This research investigates the impact of using six demonstrations characterized by high syntactic diversity and a structured sequence format on the accuracy of in-context learning for text summarization tasks. The hypothesis posits that this specific configuration will enhance the model's ability to generalize and accurately summarize text compared to configurations with fewer demonstrations or lower diversity. Syntactic diversity is achieved by including a variety of sentence structures, which exposes the model to a broader range of grammatical constructions, enhancing its linguistic understanding. The structured sequence format organizes these demonstrations in a clear and consistent manner, aiding the model in recognizing patterns and relationships within the data. This combination is expected to leverage the strengths of both high diversity and structured input, addressing gaps in prior research that often focused on either aspect in isolation. By providing a rich and organized context, this setup aims to improve the model's summarization capabilities, offering insights into optimizing demonstration configurations for in-context learning. \nKey Variables:\nNumber of Demonstrations: Six demonstrations are used to provide a balanced number of examples, offering sufficient context without overwhelming the model. This number is chosen based on prior findings indicating that six demonstrations can significantly influence the model's learning ability, particularly for tasks requiring detailed reasoning. The demonstrations are selected to maximize syntactic diversity, exposing the model to a wide range of sentence structures.\nSyntactic Diversity: Syntactic diversity is measured by analyzing the variety of sentence structures in the demonstrations. This involves parsing sentences to identify different syntactic patterns, such as simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex structures. The diversity is quantified by counting distinct syntactic patterns and comparing them to the total number of sentences. High syntactic diversity is expected to enhance the model's ability to handle complex linguistic tasks by exposing it to a broader range of grammatical constructions.\nStructured Sequence Format: The structured sequence format organizes demonstrations in a way that clearly delineates the relationships between different components of the input data. This format helps the model better understand and utilize the demonstrations by providing a clear and consistent structure. It is particularly beneficial for tasks like text summarization, where the sequence format can significantly impact performance.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to automate the experiment setup and execution. The experiment will use a pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3, to perform text summarization tasks. Six demonstrations will be selected, ensuring high syntactic diversity by including a variety of sentence structures. These demonstrations will be organized in a structured sequence format, where each demonstration is clearly defined with input-output pairs. The experiment will involve feeding these demonstrations into the model as part of the input prompt and measuring the model's summarization accuracy. The structured format will be implemented using a tabular structure, where each row represents a demonstration with columns for input text, expected output, and additional context. The model's performance will be evaluated based on its ability to accurately summarize text, with accuracy measured by comparing the generated summaries to reference summaries using ROUGE scores. The experiment will be repeated multiple times to ensure reliability, and the results will be analyzed to determine the impact of the demonstration configuration on summarization accuracy. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the ROUGE score, which measures the overlap of n-grams between the generated summary and reference summaries. This metric will assess how well the model captures the essential content of input texts when conditioned with the specified demonstration configuration. The control condition will involve using fewer demonstrations or lower syntactic diversity to compare the impact on summarization accuracy. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher ROUGE score compared to the control condition, indicating better summarization performance. The experiment will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and qualitative evaluations will be derived from analyzing the generated summaries' coherence and relevance.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether using six demonstrations with high syntactic diversity and structured format improves in-context learning for summarization tasks.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Retrieval-Augmented Semantic Retrieval\nShort Description: Evaluating retrieval-augmented contexts' impact on encoder models' semantic retrieval across 200+ languages.\nHypothesis to explore: Encoder language models, when evaluated on the MINERS benchmark using retrieval-augmented contexts, will demonstrate improved semantic retrieval performance across 200+ diverse languages, as measured by precision and recall, compared to non-augmented contexts.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Retrieval-augmented contexts\nDependent variable: Semantic retrieval performance\nComparison groups: Retrieval-augmented contexts vs. non-augmented contexts\nBaseline/control: Non-augmented contexts\nContext/setting: MINERS benchmark evaluation across 200+ diverse languages\nAssumptions: None explicitly stated\nRelationship type: Correlation\nPopulation: Encoder language models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Precision and recall\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to explore the impact of retrieval-augmented contexts on the performance of encoder language models in semantic retrieval tasks. The MINERS benchmark, which evaluates multilingual language models across over 200 languages, will serve as the testing ground. The hypothesis posits that incorporating retrieval-augmented contexts will enhance the models' ability to retrieve semantically similar data, thereby improving precision and recall metrics. This approach addresses the challenge of effectively evaluating language models in diverse linguistic contexts, including low-resource and code-switching scenarios. By leveraging retrieval-augmented contexts, the study seeks to demonstrate that encoder models can achieve higher semantic retrieval performance without requiring fine-tuning. This research fills a gap in the literature by systematically evaluating the utility of retrieval-augmented contexts in multilingual semantic retrieval, a combination not extensively explored in prior studies. The expected outcome is that retrieval-augmented contexts will provide additional semantic information that enhances the models' retrieval capabilities, leading to more accurate and reliable performance across languages. \nKey Variables:\nBenchmark Type: MINERS: MINERS is a benchmark designed to evaluate multilingual language models in semantic retrieval tasks across over 200 languages. It focuses on retrieving semantically similar data in diverse linguistic contexts, including low-resource and code-switching scenarios. The benchmark assesses models on tasks like bitext retrieval and classification via retrieval-augmented contexts, emphasizing efficiency and adaptability. MINERS is selected for its comprehensive language coverage and its ability to simulate realistic multilingual scenarios, making it an ideal choice for evaluating the impact of retrieval-augmented contexts on semantic retrieval performance.\nLanguage Coverage: 200+ Diverse Languages: The MINERS benchmark covers over 200 diverse languages, including extremely low-resource languages. This extensive language coverage is crucial for assessing the robustness of language models in retrieving semantically similar embeddings in challenging cross-lingual settings. The inclusion of such a wide range of languages ensures that the evaluation can capture the models' performance across both high-resource and low-resource languages, providing a comprehensive assessment of their semantic retrieval capabilities.\nPerformance Metrics: Precision and Recall: Precision and recall are critical metrics for evaluating the accuracy and completeness of a model's retrieval performance. Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall assesses the model's ability to identify all relevant instances. These metrics are particularly relevant for semantic retrieval tasks, where both false positives and false negatives can significantly impact performance. By focusing on precision and recall, the study aims to provide a balanced evaluation of the models' retrieval capabilities, ensuring that both accuracy and completeness are considered.\nMultilingual Language Model Type: Encoder Language Models: Encoder language models, such as BERT, are used for generating high-dimensional representations of text. These models are evaluated in the MINERS benchmark for their effectiveness in retrieving semantically similar data across diverse languages. The choice of encoder models is based on their ability to handle diverse linguistic inputs and contexts, making them suitable for tasks like bitext retrieval and classification. The study will assess the impact of retrieval-augmented contexts on these models' performance, providing insights into their effectiveness in semantic retrieval tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the MINERS benchmark to evaluate encoder language models with and without retrieval-augmented contexts. The existing codeblock for the MINERS benchmark will be utilized to set up the evaluation framework. Encoder language models, such as BERT, will be selected from pre-existing models available in the codeblock library. The retrieval-augmented contexts will be integrated by using a retrieval mechanism that identifies semantically similar data points and incorporates them into the context for evaluation. This integration will involve building a new module to handle the retrieval process, which will be evaluated alongside the encoder models. The evaluation will focus on precision and recall metrics, comparing the performance of models with and without retrieval-augmented contexts. Data flow will involve inputting multilingual data into the encoder models, retrieving similar data points, and evaluating the models' retrieval performance using the specified metrics. The hypothesis will be realized end-to-end in code by combining existing codeblocks for the MINERS benchmark and encoder models with a newly built retrieval module. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are precision and recall. Precision will measure the accuracy of the models' positive predictions, while recall will assess their ability to identify all relevant instances. The MINERS benchmark will be used as the evaluation framework, providing a comprehensive assessment of the models' performance across 200+ diverse languages. The control condition will involve evaluating encoder models without retrieval-augmented contexts, serving as a baseline for comparison. Improvement will be interpreted as higher precision and recall scores for models using retrieval-augmented contexts compared to the baseline. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and success will be indicated by a significant increase in both precision and recall metrics.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate retrieval-augmented semantic retrieval across multiple languages.

Contrastive Reward Learning uses factuality metrics to guide the model towards generating more factual summaries by differentiating between factual and non-factual outputs. Sparse Inference through Pruning enhances computational efficiency by removing redundant model weights, maintaining performance while reducing resource usage. The hypothesis posits that combining these techniques will improve factual consistency and reduce hallucination rates more effectively than using either technique alone. The XSum dataset, known for its challenging single-sentence summaries, will serve as the evaluation benchmark. This combination is expected to leverage the strengths of both methods: Contrastive Reward Learning's focus on factual accuracy and Pruning's computational efficiency, resulting in a model that is both accurate and resource-efficient. This approach addresses the gap in existing literature where the individual effects of these techniques have been explored, but their combined impact remains under-investigated. \nKey Variables:\nContrastive Reward Learning: This technique integrates contrastive learning with reward learning to enhance factuality in abstractive summarization. It uses factuality metrics to provide feedback during training, guiding the model to prioritize factually consistent summaries. This method will be implemented by incorporating human evaluation results and factuality metrics into the learning process, allowing the model to iteratively improve its ability to generate factually accurate summaries. The expected outcome is a reduction in hallucination rates and an improvement in factual consistency.\nSparse Inference with Pruning: This technique involves removing redundant weights from large language models to enhance efficiency. By identifying and eliminating weights that contribute minimally to the model's performance, the model's size and computational requirements are reduced. This approach maintains comparable performance to unpruned models while offering a more resource-efficient alternative. The expected outcome is a reduction in hallucination rates without sacrificing the quality of generated summaries.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system. The Contrastive Reward Learning framework will be integrated with the existing summarization model, using factuality metrics to guide the learning process. Sparse Inference with Pruning will be applied to the model to enhance computational efficiency. The implementation will involve the following steps: 1) Fine-tune the summarization model on the XSum dataset using Contrastive Reward Learning, incorporating factuality metrics as feedback. 2) Apply Sparse Inference with Pruning to the fine-tuned model, removing redundant weights to reduce computational load. 3) Evaluate the combined model on the XSum dataset, measuring factual consistency and hallucination rates. Existing codeblocks for contrastive learning and pruning will be utilized, with additional logic built to integrate these components. The output will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the combined approach in improving factual consistency and reducing hallucination rates. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be factual consistency, measured using the QUALS evaluation protocol. Secondary metrics include hallucination rates, assessed through human evaluations and automatic metrics. The XSum dataset will serve as the benchmark, with comparisons made against models using only Contrastive Reward Learning or Sparse Inference with Pruning. Success will be interpreted as a significant improvement in factual consistency and a reduction in hallucination rates compared to baseline models. Statistical confidence will be established through multiple runs and comparative analysis.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of combining Contrastive Reward Learning with Sparse Inference through Pruning for abstractive summarization.

RaMViD employs a novel training strategy that randomly splits frames into masked and unmasked categories, focusing computational resources on important temporal features. This method is expected to enhance temporal coherence by allowing the model to predict missing information from masked frames. Temporal Latent Smoothing further enhances temporal consistency by smoothing latent representations over time, reducing temporal jitter and ensuring coherence across frames. The Hierarchical Diffusion Process, which stacks multiple diffusion processes to refine video outputs progressively, serves as the baseline architecture. By combining these techniques, the research aims to address the challenges of maintaining temporal consistency and reducing computational demands in long video generation. The expected outcome is a more efficient video generation process with improved temporal coherence and reduced inference time, providing a novel approach to handling long video sequences. \nKey Variables:\nRandom Mask Video Diffusion (RaMViD): RaMViD is a diffusion model that employs a training strategy where video frames are randomly split into masked and unmasked categories. This approach allows the model to focus on important temporal features by predicting missing information from masked frames, enhancing temporal coherence. RaMViD is implemented using a 3D U-Net architecture, which processes video data to reconstruct masked frames based on unmasked ones. This method is particularly useful for video generation and infilling tasks, where maintaining temporal consistency is crucial.\nTemporal Latent Smoothing: Temporal Latent Smoothing is a technique used to enhance temporal consistency by smoothing latent representations of video frames. This method reduces temporal jitter and improves coherence across frames, particularly in scenarios where video frames are generated in a latent space. The smoothing process involves applying functions to latent representations during the diffusion process, complemented by inference entropy reduction techniques to stabilize video generation. This approach is effective in maintaining temporal consistency in long video sequences.\nHierarchical Diffusion Process: The Hierarchical Diffusion Process involves stacking multiple diffusion processes to refine video outputs progressively. Each layer of the hierarchy refines the output of the previous one, allowing for a coarse-to-fine approach in video generation. This method is particularly useful for handling long video sequences by maintaining temporal consistency and reducing the training-inference gap. The hierarchical structure allows for parallel generation of video segments, which are later integrated to form a coherent long video.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating Random Mask Video Diffusion (RaMViD) with Temporal Latent Smoothing within a Hierarchical Diffusion Process. The RaMViD model will be implemented using a 3D U-Net architecture, where video frames are randomly split into masked and unmasked categories. The model will be trained to predict missing information from masked frames, enhancing temporal coherence. Temporal Latent Smoothing will be applied to the latent representations of video frames, reducing temporal jitter and ensuring coherence across frames. This will involve applying smoothing functions to latent representations during the diffusion process, complemented by inference entropy reduction techniques. The Hierarchical Diffusion Process will serve as the baseline architecture, stacking multiple diffusion processes to refine video outputs progressively. Each layer of the hierarchy will refine the output of the previous one, allowing for a coarse-to-fine approach in video generation. The integration of these components will be achieved by adapting existing codeblocks for RaMViD and Temporal Latent Smoothing, and building new modules for their integration within the Hierarchical Diffusion Process. The implementation will involve setting up the 3D U-Net architecture for RaMViD, applying smoothing functions for Temporal Latent Smoothing, and configuring the hierarchical structure for the diffusion process. The data flow will involve processing video frames through the RaMViD model, applying Temporal Latent Smoothing, and refining outputs through the Hierarchical Diffusion Process. The expected outcome is a more efficient video generation process with improved temporal coherence and reduced inference time. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be temporal coherence score and average inference time per frame. Temporal coherence score will measure the consistency of motion and appearance across video frames, with higher scores indicating better temporal consistency. Average inference time per frame will quantify the computational efficiency of the video generation process, with lower times indicating faster inference. The hypothesis will be tested using benchmark video datasets for long video generation. The control condition will be the Hierarchical Diffusion Process without the integration of RaMViD and Temporal Latent Smoothing. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant increase in temporal coherence score and a reduction in average inference time per frame compared to the control condition. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and qualitative assessments will be derived from visual inspections of generated videos to verify temporal consistency.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing a baseline Hierarchical Diffusion Process against an enhanced version that integrates RaMViD (Random Mask Video Diffusion) and Temporal Latent Smoothing for long video generation.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Two-Stage BERT Defense\nShort Description: Integrating a two-stage detection approach with BERT and model pruning to enhance NLP backdoor defense.\nHypothesis to explore: Implementing a two-stage detection approach using statistical analysis followed by BERT for contextual understanding will improve the precision and neutralization rate of word-level backdoor attacks on NLP models, while maintaining computational efficiency through model pruning.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Two-stage detection approach using statistical analysis followed by BERT\nDependent variable: Precision and neutralization rate of word-level backdoor attacks\nComparison groups: Not explicitly mentioned\nBaseline/control: Not explicitly mentioned\nContext/setting: NLP models\nAssumptions: Model pruning will maintain computational efficiency\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: NLP models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Not explicitly mentioned\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of a two-stage detection approach with BERT for contextual understanding to enhance the precision and neutralization rate of word-level backdoor attacks on NLP models. The first stage employs statistical analysis to detect anomalies in text inputs, while the second stage uses BERT to confirm the presence of backdoor triggers, leveraging its contextual understanding capabilities. To maintain computational efficiency, model pruning is applied to reduce the size of the neural network by removing less significant weights, ensuring the approach is feasible for environments with limited resources. This combination is expected to provide a robust defense mechanism by accurately identifying backdoor triggers and neutralizing them, while also ensuring the system remains efficient in terms of resource usage. This research addresses gaps in existing literature by combining these techniques in a novel way, aiming to improve detection accuracy and computational efficiency simultaneously. \nKey Variables:\nDetection Accuracy - Precision: Precision is chosen as it measures the number of true positive identifications of backdoor attacks divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. This metric is crucial in scenarios where the cost of false positives is high, ensuring that benign inputs are not incorrectly labeled as backdoor attacks. Precision will be calculated by analyzing the output of the detection mechanism to count the number of correctly identified backdoor instances and dividing this by the total number of instances flagged as backdoors.\nNeutralization Rate - Two-stage detection approach: The two-stage detection approach involves using statistical analysis followed by deep learning techniques to identify and neutralize backdoor triggers. The first stage detects anomalies in text patterns, while the second stage confirms these findings using BERT's contextual understanding. This method enhances security by accurately identifying and neutralizing backdoor triggers, reducing the attack success rate.\nComputational Efficiency - Model Pruning: Model pruning is used to reduce the size of the neural network by removing weights that contribute less to the model's output. This technique helps in reducing computational demands, making it suitable for environments with limited resources. Pruned models maintain performance while requiring fewer computational resources, leading to faster inference times and reduced memory usage.\nMachine Learning Algorithm - BERT for Contextual Understanding: BERT is utilized for its ability to understand context in text, making it suitable for detecting subtle backdoor triggers that rely on contextual cues. The implementation involves fine-tuning BERT on a dataset with both clean and backdoored samples, using a masked language model objective to enhance its contextual understanding.\n\nImplementation: The implementation will begin with setting up a two-stage detection approach. The first stage involves statistical analysis to detect anomalies in text inputs, which will be implemented using existing statistical analysis libraries. The second stage will utilize BERT for contextual understanding, leveraging its pre-trained model to confirm the presence of backdoor triggers. BERT will be fine-tuned on a dataset containing both clean and backdoored samples to enhance its ability to detect contextual anomalies. Model pruning will be applied to the neural network to maintain computational efficiency, using existing pruning techniques to remove less significant weights. This will ensure the model remains efficient in terms of resource usage while maintaining performance. The integration of these components will be managed through a custom-built pipeline that orchestrates the flow of data between the statistical analysis, BERT model, and pruning process. The pipeline will be implemented in Python, utilizing libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for model handling, and scikit-learn for statistical analysis. The system will be tested on standard NLP datasets to evaluate its effectiveness in improving detection accuracy and computational efficiency. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluation will be precision, measuring the number of true positive identifications of backdoor attacks divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. The secondary metric will be the neutralization rate, assessed by the reduction in attack success rate. Computational efficiency will be evaluated by measuring resource usage and processing time before and after model pruning. The system will be tested on standard NLP datasets, with baseline comparisons made against models without the two-stage detection approach or model pruning. Success will be interpreted as a significant improvement in precision and neutralization rate, alongside maintained or improved computational efficiency.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing a baseline BERT-based backdoor detection system against a two-stage detection system. The experiment should have three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nPILOT MODES:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 clean and 10 backdoored samples from training set\n- PILOT: Use 100 clean and 100 backdoored samples from training set for training, 50 each from dev set for evaluation\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset (but do not implement this mode yet)\n\nSYSTEMS TO IMPLEMENT:\n1.

Precision: (true_positives)/(true_positives + false_positives)\n2. Neutralization Rate: Percentage of correctly identified and neutralized backdoor triggers\n3.

If MINI_PILOT successful, run PILOT:\n   - Train on 200 samples (100 clean, 100 backdoored)\n   - Test on 100 dev set samples (50 clean, 50 backdoored)\n   - Report all metrics\n   - Generate line plots comparing processing time\n   - Perform bootstrap resampling to test for significant differences\n\n3.

Motivation inferences involve understanding the underlying motivations behind dialogue utterances, which can be achieved by training models on datasets like CICERO. Prosody analysis, on the other hand, involves examining textual cues such as punctuation and capitalization to infer tone. By combining these two approaches, the dialogue system can generate responses that are both contextually relevant and personalized, as it considers both the user's motivations and the tone of their input. This integration is expected to improve the naturalness and engagement of the dialogue, as the system can tailor responses that align with the user's emotional state and underlying motivations. The novelty of this approach lies in the combination of motivation inferences and prosody analysis, which has not been extensively explored in existing literature. The expected outcome is a dialogue system that provides more coherent and empathetic responses, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement. \nKey Variables:\nMotivation Inferences: Motivation inferences involve understanding the underlying reasons behind dialogue utterances. This is achieved by curating datasets like CICERO, which contain inferences about motivations, and using them to train dialogue models. The implementation involves generating and selecting motivation-related inferences from dialogue contexts and integrating them into response generation. This approach ensures that the responses reflect an understanding of the speaker's motivations, enhancing the relevance and engagement of the dialogue. The expected role of motivation inferences in this research is to provide a deeper understanding of the user's intentions, which will be used to generate more personalized responses.\nProsody Analysis for Tone Detection: Prosody analysis involves examining textual cues such as punctuation, capitalization, and other features to infer tone. This method can be implemented using machine learning models trained on datasets with prosodic annotations. The dialogue system can use these prosodic features to adjust its response style, such as using more formal language for serious tones or casual language for friendly tones. The expected role of prosody analysis in this research is to provide a nuanced understanding of the user's emotional state, which will be used to generate responses that are emotionally congruent with the user's input.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate motivation inferences and prosody analysis for tone detection. The implementation will involve using existing codeblocks for prosody analysis and building new modules for motivation inference integration. The prosody analysis will be conducted using a machine learning model trained on a dataset with prosodic annotations, which will be used to infer the tone of the user's input. Simultaneously, the motivation inference module will be developed using the CICERO dataset to train a model that can generate and select motivation-related inferences from dialogue contexts. These inferences will be integrated into the response generation process, allowing the system to produce responses that are both contextually relevant and personalized. The data flow will involve feeding the user's input into the prosody analysis module to determine the tone, followed by the motivation inference module to understand the underlying motivations. The outputs from both modules will be combined to generate a response that aligns with the user's emotional state and motivations. The integration will be facilitated by a glue module that combines the outputs from both modules and feeds them into the response generator. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the contextual relevance and personalization of the generated responses, measured using user satisfaction scores and engagement metrics. The secondary metric will be the coherence and empathy of the responses, assessed through qualitative evaluations by human judges. The hypothesis will be tested using a benchmark dataset of open-domain dialogues, with a control condition involving a baseline system that uses only one of the approaches (either motivation inferences or prosody analysis). Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in user satisfaction and engagement scores compared to the baseline system. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with qualitative evaluations providing additional insights into the effectiveness of the integrated approach.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether integrating motivation inferences with prosody analysis improves dialogue system responses.

If successful, run PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT.\n\nDATASET GENERATION:\n1. Generate a set of dialogue contexts using gpt-4o-mini.

The GRL is employed to achieve domain invariance by reversing the gradient during backpropagation, which encourages the model to learn domain-invariant features. PET is utilized to leverage sentiment-labeled datasets by converting input examples into cloze-style questions, thereby enhancing the model's understanding of sentiment and stance relationships. This combination is hypothesized to improve the macro F1 score of stance detection models compared to BERT and XLM-R baselines. The research aims to demonstrate that integrating domain-adversarial training with sentiment-based pre-training can effectively generalize across different domains and languages, addressing limitations in cross-domain and cross-lingual stance detection. By focusing on social media as the domain, the study targets the unique challenges posed by informal language and diverse sentiment expressions, providing insights into the potential of combining adversarial and pattern-based techniques for robust stance detection. \nKey Variables:\nGradient Reversal Layer: The Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) is a component used in domain-adversarial training to achieve domain invariance in feature extraction. It acts as an identity function during the forward pass but reverses the gradient during the backward pass, encouraging the model to learn features that are indistinguishable by the domain classifier. In this research, GRL is integrated into the neural network architecture between the feature extractor and the domain classifier. The GRL is expected to help the model generalize across different domains by minimizing domain discrepancies, directly influencing the macro F1 score by improving cross-domain performance.\nPattern-Exploiting Training: Pattern-Exploiting Training (PET) involves using manually crafted patterns to convert input examples into cloze-style questions, fine-tuning a pre-trained language model. For this research, PET is adapted to leverage sentiment-labeled datasets by designing patterns that incorporate sentiment cues. This approach aims to enhance the model's ability to detect stance by learning the semantic relationships between sentiment and stance. PET is expected to improve the macro F1 score by enabling the model to capture sentiment nuances, particularly in social media contexts where sentiment expressions are diverse and informal.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the following approach: First, a neural network architecture will be set up with a feature extractor, domain classifier, and a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) integrated between them. The GRL will be responsible for reversing the gradient during backpropagation to achieve domain invariance. Next, Pattern-Exploiting Training (PET) will be applied by designing sentiment-based patterns to convert input examples into cloze-style questions. These patterns will be used to fine-tune a pre-trained language model, such as BERT or XLM-R, on sentiment-labeled datasets. The model will be trained and evaluated on English and Spanish social media datasets, focusing on the macro F1 score as the primary metric. Existing codeblocks for implementing GRL and PET will be utilized, with additional glue logic built to integrate these components. The data flow will involve passing input examples through the PET module to generate cloze-style questions, which are then processed by the neural network with GRL to learn domain-invariant features. The output will be evaluated against BERT and XLM-R baselines to assess improvements in stance detection performance. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is the macro F1 score, which measures the average F1 score across favor and against labels. This metric is chosen for its ability to handle class imbalance by treating each class equally. The hypothesis will be tested using English and Spanish social media datasets, with BERT and XLM-R serving as baseline models. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in the macro F1 score compared to the baselines. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure robustness, with statistical confidence assessed through significance tests. The macro F1 score will be calculated based on precision and recall, providing a comprehensive measure of the model's performance in stance detection tasks.\nResearch idea design: Please create a stance detection experiment that compares a GRL-PET integrated model against BERT and XLM-R baselines. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nPILOT MODES:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 examples each from English and Spanish social media stance detection training data\n- PILOT: Use 100 examples each from English/Spanish training data for training, 50 each from dev set for evaluation\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use complete datasets (but do not implement this mode yet)\n\nDATASETS:\n1.

Log all results, including:\n   - Per-example predictions and scores\n   - Aggregate metrics\n   - Statistical test results\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Create detailed logs of:\n   - Training progress\n   - Evaluation results\n   - Error cases\n   - Statistical comparisons\n2. Generate a summary report with:\n   - Macro F1 scores for each model\n   - Statistical significance results\n   - Key findings\n\nRUN SEQUENCE:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT mode\n3. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT (await human verification)\n\nPlease implement this experiment using appropriate error handling and logging throughout. The focus should be on creating a reliable pilot implementation that can validate the experimental setup before proceeding to the full experiment. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

The numerically-aware GNN is designed to perform numerical reasoning by leveraging graph structures that represent relationships between numerical entities, enhancing the model's ability to handle complex reasoning tasks. The graph-based verification approach constructs reasoning graphs from generated solutions and evaluates these graphs to ensure logical consistency and accuracy. By combining these two techniques, the research aims to address the limitations of each method when used independently. The numerically-aware GNN provides a robust framework for numerical reasoning, while the graph-based verification ensures the correctness of the reasoning paths. This combination is expected to yield better performance in terms of solution accuracy and computational efficiency, as the GNN's numerical reasoning capabilities are complemented by the verification approach's ability to refine and validate reasoning paths. This research will contribute to the field by demonstrating a novel integration of techniques that addresses both accuracy and efficiency in mathematical problem-solving. \nKey Variables:\nNumerically-Aware Graph Neural Network: This variable represents the use of a graph neural network specifically designed to handle numerical reasoning tasks. The GNN constructs a graph from the problem text, using nodes to represent numbers and edges to capture arithmetic operations or comparisons. This structure allows the network to perform tasks such as numerical comparison and arithmetic reasoning, enhancing the model's ability to handle complex reasoning tasks. The numerically-aware GNN is selected for its ability to explicitly model numerical relationships, which are often implicit in natural language, providing a structured approach to numerical reasoning.\nGraph-Based Verification Approach: This variable involves constructing reasoning graphs from the solutions generated by language models and using these graphs to verify the correctness of the solutions. Each reasoning path is represented as a graph, where nodes correspond to intermediate reasoning steps, and edges denote logical connections between these steps. The implementation includes generating multiple reasoning paths for a given problem, constructing graphs from these paths, and using a verifier to evaluate the consistency and correctness of the graphs. This method allows for a more robust assessment of the reasoning process, ensuring that the final solution is logically sound and accurate.\nGSM8K Dataset: The GSM8K dataset is used as the benchmark for evaluating the performance of the proposed integration. It contains a variety of math word problems that test the reasoning capabilities of large language models. The dataset serves as a standard for comparing different reasoning frameworks and prompting strategies, providing a consistent basis for evaluation.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by first constructing a numerically-aware graph neural network (GNN) that processes math word problems from the GSM8K dataset. The GNN will parse the problem text to create a graph structure where nodes represent numerical entities and edges capture arithmetic operations or comparisons. This graph will be used to perform numerical reasoning tasks. Concurrently, a graph-based verification approach will be employed to construct reasoning graphs from the solutions generated by the GNN. These reasoning graphs will be evaluated for logical consistency and correctness using a trained verifier. The implementation will involve setting up a pipeline where the GNN outputs are fed into the graph-based verification module. Existing codeblocks for graph neural networks and graph-based verification will be adapted and integrated into this pipeline. The GNN will be configured to handle numerical reasoning tasks, and the verification module will be trained to evaluate reasoning graphs for accuracy. The entire process will be automated using the CodeScientist platform, which will handle the experiment setup, execution, and analysis. The expected outcome is an improvement in both the accuracy and computational efficiency of solving math word problems, as the GNN's numerical reasoning capabilities are complemented by the verification approach's ability to refine and validate reasoning paths. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the Exact Match (EM) Score, which measures the solution accuracy by checking if the predicted answer exactly matches the correct answer. The secondary metric will be computational efficiency, measured by the time taken to solve each problem. The GSM8K dataset will serve as the benchmark, with the proposed integration compared against baseline models using either the numerically-aware GNN or the graph-based verification approach alone. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher EM score and reduced computational time compared to the baselines. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical significance, with confidence intervals calculated to assess the reliability of the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate whether integrating a numerically-aware graph neural network with a graph-based verification approach improves math problem-solving accuracy and efficiency. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot phases (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable.\n\nDataset:\n- Use the GSM8K dataset from Huggingface Hub\n- MINI_PILOT: Use first 10 problems from training set\n- PILOT: Use first 200 problems from training set, and first 50 from validation set\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset (but we won't run this initially)\n\nConditions to implement:\n1.

The hypothesis posits that this hybrid approach will enhance precision and reduce RLHF-induced abstention rates compared to models fine-tuned solely with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The motivation stems from the need to improve LLMs' ability to handle complex legal texts, where precision is crucial to avoid misinterpretation of legal facts. Continual pre-training enhances the model's understanding of domain-specific knowledge, while instruction tuning refines its ability to follow legal-specific prompts. This combination is expected to leverage the strengths of both methods, resulting in a model that is both knowledgeable and adept at handling legal instructions. The expected outcome is a model that not only performs better in terms of precision but also exhibits lower abstention rates, thereby increasing its reliability in legal applications. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing a more comprehensive training strategy that balances domain knowledge with task-specific instruction following. \nKey Variables:\nInstruction Tuning Method: The hybrid approach of continual pre-training followed by domain-specific instruction tuning involves first enhancing the model's domain knowledge through continual pre-training on raw legal data. This is followed by instruction tuning using a dataset of legal documents to refine the model's ability to follow legal-specific prompts. This method was chosen for its potential to combine the broad domain understanding from CPT with the task-specific precision of instruction tuning, directly influencing the model's performance in legal document summarization.\nDataset Type: Legal documents are used as the domain-specific dataset for instruction tuning. This involves compiling a comprehensive corpus of legal texts, such as case law and statutes, which are used to train the model. The dataset's quality and relevance are crucial, as they directly impact the model's ability to generalize and perform well on unseen legal tasks. The choice of legal documents is driven by the need to enhance the model's understanding of legal language and reasoning patterns.\nTask Type: Legal document summarization involves processing and condensing large volumes of legal text into concise summaries. This task requires the model to understand complex legal terminologies and concepts. The implementation involves using a dataset of legal documents to train the model, enhancing its ability to comprehend and summarize legal texts effectively. The task is chosen to evaluate the model's precision and abstention rate in a domain where accuracy is critical.\nAccuracy: Precision is the primary metric for evaluating the model's performance in legal document summarization. It measures the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of positive predictions. Precision is critical in legal tasks to ensure that the model correctly identifies relevant information without including irrelevant data. The choice of precision as a metric reflects the need to minimize false positives in legal document processing.\nAbstention Rate: RLHF-induced abstention rate is measured by the proportion of instances where the model chooses not to respond due to uncertainty. This metric is particularly relevant in legal tasks where models trained with RLHF can exhibit higher abstention rates. The goal is to reduce this rate through the hybrid approach, thereby increasing the model's confidence and reliability in providing answers.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging its capabilities to design, iterate, and analyze experiments in Python. The implementation begins with continual pre-training of a pre-trained LLM using a corpus of raw legal data to enhance domain knowledge. This is followed by domain-specific instruction tuning using a dataset of legal documents. The instruction tuning process involves crafting legal-specific prompts and input-output pairs to guide the model in generating appropriate responses. Precision and RLHF-induced abstention rates will be measured using a labeled dataset of legal document summarization tasks. The experiment will utilize existing codeblocks for data preprocessing and model evaluation, while new modules will be built for the hybrid training approach. Data flows from the pre-training phase to the instruction tuning phase, with outputs evaluated against ground truth labels to assess precision and abstention rates. The end-to-end process involves setting up the model configurations, executing the training phases, and analyzing the results using the specified metrics. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is precision, which measures the model's ability to correctly identify relevant information in legal document summarization tasks. The secondary metric is the RLHF-induced abstention rate, which quantifies the model's tendency to abstain from providing answers due to uncertainty. The hypothesis will be tested using a benchmark dataset of legal documents, with precision calculated as the ratio of true positive predictions to total positive predictions. Abstention rate will be measured as the proportion of instances where the model chooses not to respond. Improvement will be interpreted as higher precision and lower abstention rates compared to a baseline model fine-tuned with SFT alone. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with success indicated by a significant increase in precision and reduction in abstention rate.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to evaluate whether a hybrid approach (continual pre-training + instruction tuning) improves legal document summarization compared to supervised fine-tuning alone. The experiment should use gpt-4o-mini as the base model.\n\nGlobal Configuration:\n- Set PILOT_MODE to one of: ['MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', 'FULL_EXPERIMENT']\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 legal documents from training set\n- PILOT: Use 100 legal documents from training set, 20 from dev set\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset (but do not run this mode initially)\n\nDataset:\n1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Privacy-Enhanced BERT\nShort Description: Combining token-level loss optimization and adversarial regularization to enhance BERT model privacy in clinical text.\nHypothesis to explore: Combining token-level loss optimization with adversarial regularization in BERT models significantly reduces susceptibility to membership inference attacks in the clinical text domain, while maintaining high precision and recall.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Combining token-level loss optimization with adversarial regularization\nDependent variable: Susceptibility to membership inference attacks\nComparison groups: Not explicitly stated\nBaseline/control: Not explicitly stated\nContext/setting: Clinical text domain\nAssumptions: The combination will maintain high precision and recall\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: BERT models in the clinical text domain\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Not explicitly stated\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of token-level loss optimization and adversarial regularization to enhance privacy protection in BERT models trained on clinical text data. Token-level loss optimization categorizes tokens into 'hard' and 'memorized' tokens, optimizing the model to focus on learning from the former while unlearning the latter, thereby reducing memorization of sensitive data. Adversarial regularization introduces an adversarial component during training, penalizing the model for overconfidence on training samples, further mitigating membership inference attacks. This study hypothesizes that the combined approach will significantly reduce the model's susceptibility to such attacks, as measured by precision and recall, without degrading performance. The clinical text domain is chosen due to its sensitivity and the need for robust privacy measures. This approach addresses gaps in existing defenses by leveraging the sequential nature of text data and adversarial training, offering a novel solution to privacy risks in language models. \nKey Variables:\nToken-level Loss Optimization: Token-level loss optimization involves categorizing tokens into 'hard' tokens for learning and 'memorized' tokens for unlearning. This strategy optimizes a dual-purpose token-level loss function to balance utility and privacy, mitigating membership inference attacks. The implementation requires analyzing token dynamics and selecting tokens that contribute to model learning while minimizing memorization. This method is expected to provide strong protection against MIAs and improve language modeling performance across various architectures and datasets.\nAdversarial Regularization: Adversarial regularization incorporates membership inference attacks as an adversarial component during the training process. This approach aims to balance model utility and privacy by training the model to perform well on the primary task while minimizing the success of membership inference attacks. The implementation involves adding an adversarial loss term to the training objective, penalizing the model for being too confident on training samples. This technique requires careful tuning of hyperparameters to ensure that the model remains effective while providing privacy protection.\nBERT Model: BERT models are pre-trained using masked language modeling, which involves reconstructing a version of the training data where some tokens have been replaced with [MASK] tokens. This pre-training is performed using large text corpora, potentially containing sensitive information. The study evaluates the effects of pseudonymization on Swedish clinical BERT models fine-tuned for five clinical NLP tasks. The implementation involved a large number of statistical tests to assess the impact on predictive performance, revealing minimal harm when using pseudonymized fine-tuning data. This demonstrates that pseudonymizing training data can reduce privacy risks without harming data utility for training BERT models.\nClinical Text Domain: The clinical text domain involves training models on datasets that contain sensitive health information, such as electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical notes. In the paper, Swedish clinical BERT models were fine-tuned for five clinical NLP tasks, demonstrating the application of pseudonymization to both pre-training and fine-tuning data. This domain requires rigorous pseudonymization techniques to replace sensitive entities with non-sensitive surrogates, ensuring privacy while maintaining data utility. The study performed a large number of statistical tests to evaluate the impact on predictive performance, revealing minimal harm when using pseudonymized data. This domain is particularly sensitive due to the nature of the data, necessitating strict privacy-preserving measures.\nPrecision: Precision is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of a model by measuring the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions made by the model. In the context of pseudonymization in language models like BERT, GPT-2, and LLaMA, precision can be particularly relevant when assessing tasks such as named entity recognition, where the accurate identification of sensitive entities is crucial. Implementing precision measurement involves setting up a test dataset with known outcomes and comparing the model's predictions against these outcomes. Precision is often used alongside recall to provide a balanced view of model performance, especially in scenarios where false positives carry significant implications, such as in clinical or legal text processing.\nRecall: Recall measures the ability of a model to identify all relevant instances in a dataset, calculated as the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positives. In the context of pseudonymization, recall is crucial for ensuring that all sensitive entities are correctly identified and replaced, minimizing the risk of privacy breaches. To measure recall, a comprehensive dataset with annotated sensitive entities is used, and the model's ability to detect these entities is evaluated. High recall is particularly important in domains like healthcare or legal text processing, where missing a sensitive entity could lead to significant privacy violations.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate token-level loss optimization and adversarial regularization in BERT models trained on clinical text data. The process begins with setting up a BERT model pre-trained on masked language modeling tasks. Token-level loss optimization will be implemented by analyzing token dynamics to categorize tokens into 'hard' and 'memorized' categories. This involves modifying the loss function to focus on learning from 'hard' tokens while minimizing memorization of 'memorized' tokens. Adversarial regularization will be incorporated by adding an adversarial loss term to the training objective, which penalizes the model for overconfidence on training samples. This requires careful tuning of hyperparameters to balance model utility and privacy. The clinical text data will be preprocessed to replace sensitive entities with non-sensitive surrogates, ensuring privacy while maintaining data utility. The model's performance will be evaluated using precision and recall metrics, with a focus on maintaining high accuracy in identifying sensitive entities. CodeScientist will automate the experiment setup, execution, and analysis, leveraging existing codeblocks for BERT model implementation and training, while building new components for token-level loss optimization and adversarial regularization. The integration of these techniques is expected to reduce the model's susceptibility to membership inference attacks without degrading performance. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are precision and recall, which will assess the model's ability to accurately identify and replace sensitive entities in clinical text data. Precision measures the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions, while recall measures the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positives. These metrics will be calculated using a test dataset with annotated sensitive entities, comparing the model's predictions against known outcomes. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the performance of the BERT model with and without the integration of token-level loss optimization and adversarial regularization. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant reduction in membership inference attack susceptibility, as indicated by higher precision and recall, without degrading overall model performance. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with thresholds set for acceptable levels of precision and recall to determine success.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a privacy-enhanced BERT experiment comparing a baseline BERT model against a privacy-enhanced version using token-level loss optimization and adversarial regularization.

The Multimodal Transformer Model is adept at capturing long-range dependencies across text, audio, and visual inputs, while Dynamic Attention Fusion dynamically adjusts the contribution of each modality based on context. The CMU-MOSEI dataset, known for its diverse multimodal sentiment data, will be used to evaluate the proposed approach. By leveraging the strengths of both the Multimodal Transformer and Dynamic Attention Fusion, the study hypothesizes that the combined model will outperform existing methods in terms of F1 Score, particularly in scenarios where certain modalities are missing or unreliable. This research fills a gap in existing literature by specifically addressing the challenge of uncertain missing modalities, a common issue in real-world applications, and proposes a novel combination of techniques to enhance sentiment analysis accuracy. \nKey Variables:\nMultimodal Transformer Model: The Multimodal Transformer Model extends the standard transformer architecture to handle unaligned multimodal data, incorporating attention mechanisms to dynamically adjust weights between text, audio, and visual modalities. It is implemented by feeding each modality through separate transformer encoders, followed by a cross-modal attention mechanism that aligns and integrates information. This model is chosen for its ability to capture complex intermodal interactions and improve sentiment analysis accuracy, especially in datasets like CMU-MOSEI where modality interactions are crucial.\nDynamic Attention Fusion: Dynamic Attention Fusion evaluates the importance of each modality for a given input and assigns weights accordingly, using attention scores derived from the correlation between multimodal features and sentiment knowledge. This approach enhances adaptability to various scenarios by prioritizing modalities that contribute more to sentiment prediction. It is implemented using attention scores to guide the fusion process, making it particularly effective in scenarios with missing or unreliable modalities.\nF1 Score: The F1 Score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric for evaluating sentiment analysis performance, especially in imbalanced datasets. It is calculated using the formula F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall), and is crucial for assessing the overall effectiveness of the proposed model in capturing sentiment accurately across different modalities.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the Multimodal Transformer Model and Dynamic Attention Fusion techniques. The Multimodal Transformer Model will be constructed using existing transformer encoders for each modality (text, audio, visual), followed by a cross-modal attention layer to integrate information. Dynamic Attention Fusion will be implemented by calculating attention scores for each modality based on their correlation with sentiment knowledge, dynamically adjusting their weights during the fusion process. The CMU-MOSEI dataset will be used, with preprocessing steps to align and synchronize the modalities. The experiment will involve training the model on the dataset, evaluating its performance using the F1 Score, and comparing it against baseline models without Dynamic Attention Fusion. The integration of these components will be facilitated by existing codeblocks for transformer models and attention mechanisms, with additional glue logic to handle data flow and modality synchronization. The expected outcome is an improved F1 Score, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in handling uncertain missing modalities. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is the F1 Score, which balances precision and recall to provide a comprehensive measure of sentiment analysis performance. The CMU-MOSEI dataset will serve as the benchmark, with the control condition being a baseline model without Dynamic Attention Fusion. Success will be interpreted as a statistically significant improvement in F1 Score compared to the baseline, with multiple runs to ensure robustness. Secondary metrics may include precision and recall individually, to provide additional insights into the model's performance across different sentiment classes.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of a Multimodal Transformer with Dynamic Fusion for sentiment analysis.

BERT's bidirectional attention mechanism is utilized to generate candidate triples, leveraging its contextual understanding to improve the initial candidate set's quality. These candidates are then refined using AnyBURL, where reinforcement learning guides the path sampling process. This approach focuses computational resources on the most promising paths, potentially reducing runtime and improving prediction accuracy. The integration is expected to capitalize on BERT's ability to understand complex relationships and reinforcement learning's efficiency in path selection, addressing gaps in previous methods that either lacked contextual understanding or efficient resource allocation. The expected outcome is a more efficient and accurate knowledge graph completion process, particularly in large-scale datasets like Freebase, where computational resources and prediction quality are critical. \nKey Variables:\nIntegration of BERT for Candidate Generation: BERT is employed as the Transformer model for generating candidate triples in the integration with AnyBURL. Its bidirectional attention mechanisms allow it to capture context from both directions, making it effective for understanding complex relationships in knowledge graphs. BERT is fine-tuned on the Freebase dataset, and its output is formatted to align with AnyBURL's input requirements. This setup enhances the quality of candidate triples by leveraging BERT's contextual understanding, directly influencing the prediction quality by providing a more accurate initial set of candidates.\nReinforcement Learning for Path Sampling: Reinforcement learning is incorporated into AnyBURL to guide path sampling, optimizing the selection of paths that are most likely to lead to correct rule generation. The reinforcement learning model is trained on historical data to learn which paths yield the highest quality predictions. This approach enhances computational efficiency by focusing resources on the most promising paths, potentially improving both runtime and prediction quality. The integration with BERT involves using BERT's predictions as initial paths, which are then refined through reinforcement learning-guided sampling.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities, leveraging existing codeblocks and building new components as needed. First, BERT will be fine-tuned on the Freebase dataset to generate candidate triples. This involves using a pre-trained BERT model, adapting it to the specific domain of knowledge graph completion, and ensuring its output aligns with AnyBURL's input format. Next, AnyBURL will be modified to incorporate reinforcement learning for path sampling. This requires building a reinforcement learning model that can learn from historical data to prioritize paths that lead to high-confidence rule generation. The integration process involves using BERT's output as input to AnyBURL, where the reinforcement learning model guides the sampling process. Data flows from BERT's candidate generation to AnyBURL's rule refinement, with the reinforcement learning model dynamically adjusting path selection based on feedback. This setup ensures that the system capitalizes on BERT's contextual understanding and reinforcement learning's efficiency, resulting in improved computational efficiency and prediction quality. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are computational efficiency (measured by runtime and memory usage) and prediction quality (measured by F1-score). The Freebase dataset will serve as the benchmark, with the control condition being standalone AnyBURL without BERT integration or reinforcement learning. Improvement will be interpreted as a reduction in runtime and memory usage, alongside an increase in F1-score compared to the baseline. The hypothesis will be tested over multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with success indicated by consistent improvements across these metrics. Qualitative evaluations will be derived from the system's ability to generate accurate and efficient knowledge graph completions, as demonstrated by the metrics.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot study comparing baseline AnyBURL against a BERT-RL enhanced version for knowledge graph completion. The experiment should have three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nPILOT MODES:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use only 10 knowledge graph completion tasks from the training set, with a maximum of 5 path samples per task\n- PILOT: Use 100 tasks from training set for training, 50 from dev set for evaluation, with up to 20 path samples per task\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full datasets with original parameters (but don't run this yet)\n\nCOMPONENTS TO IMPLEMENT:\n1.

Signal transformations, such as time-stretching, are applied to enhance the robustness of discrete speech representations by training models on transformed signals, making them resilient to input variations. Bottleneck adapters, on the other hand, are lightweight modules that reduce the dimensionality of activations between layers, allowing for efficient parameter updates. By integrating these two techniques, the study aims to improve both the robustness and BLEU scores of speech translation models. The hypothesis is that the combination will outperform models using only one of the techniques, as signal transformations enhance input robustness while bottleneck adapters optimize model parameters efficiently. This approach addresses the challenge of data scarcity in low-resource languages like Punjabi by leveraging robust representations and efficient parameter tuning, potentially leading to significant improvements in translation quality. \nKey Variables:\nSignal Transformations: Signal transformations involve applying techniques like time-stretching to speech signals to improve the robustness of discrete speech representations. This process helps the model become resilient to variations in input data, ensuring consistent performance. The transformations are applied during training, and their effectiveness is evaluated using encoding and modeling metrics. This variable is crucial for enhancing the model's ability to handle diverse and potentially noisy input conditions, especially in low-resource settings.\nBottleneck Adapters: Bottleneck adapters are lightweight modules inserted into pre-trained models to reduce the dimensionality of activations between layers. They consist of a down-projection to a smaller dimensionality, followed by a non-linearity, and an up-projection back to the original size. This structure allows for significant parameter savings, as only the adapter parameters are updated during fine-tuning. Bottleneck adapters are effective in achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning while updating only a fraction of the model parameters, making them ideal for low-resource language scenarios.\nPunjabi-English Language Pair: Punjabi-English is a low-resource language pair chosen for this study due to the lack of extensive parallel data for training robust models. The focus on this language pair highlights the need for research efforts to ensure speech technology accessibility for speakers of low-resource languages. The study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in improving translation quality for this specific language pair.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to design, iterate, and analyze experiments. The implementation will involve the following steps: First, apply signal transformations, such as time-stretching, to the speech data to create a robust dataset. This will be done using existing libraries for audio processing. Next, integrate bottleneck adapters into a pre-trained multilingual speech translation model. This involves inserting adapter modules between layers of the model to reduce dimensionality and optimize parameter updates. The model will be trained on the transformed dataset, and its performance will be evaluated using BLEU scores and robustness metrics. The implementation will utilize existing codeblocks for model training and evaluation, while new code will be developed for integrating signal transformations and bottleneck adapters. The data flow will involve preprocessing the speech data with transformations, feeding it into the model with adapters, and evaluating the output using established metrics. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the performance of the integrated model against models using only one of the techniques. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are BLEU scores and robustness metrics. BLEU scores will measure the translation quality of the model, while robustness metrics will assess the model's ability to maintain performance under various signal transformations. The benchmark tasks will involve translating Punjabi speech to English text, using a control condition where models are trained without the integration of both techniques. Improvement will be interpreted as higher BLEU scores and consistent robustness metrics compared to baseline models. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and results will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the integrated approach.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing three approaches to Punjabi-English speech translation, using gpt-4o-mini as the base model. The experiment should have three possible modes controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable ('MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', 'FULL_EXPERIMENT').\n\nConditions to compare:\n1.

BLEU scores for each condition\n2. Robustness metrics (BLEU score variance across transformations)\n3. Training time and parameter counts\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Use bootstrap resampling to compare BLEU scores between conditions\n2. Generate line plots showing BLEU scores across different time-stretch variations\n3. Log all results, including full trajectories of training\n\nRequired outputs:\n1. Logs of all experimental steps\n2. BLEU score comparisons between conditions\n3. Plots of performance across different signal transformations\n4. Statistical significance results\n\nPlease run the MINI_PILOT first. If successful, run the PILOT. Stop after the PILOT - do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT without human verification of pilot results.\n\nNote: Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM operations. Ensure all random seeds are set for reproducibility. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

The SE-GCN leverages semantic and syntactic insights through graph convolution and attention mechanisms, improving the model's ability to capture nuanced language features. Meanwhile, the Span-Level Interaction Model focuses on interactions between complete spans of aspects and opinions, addressing limitations of word-pair interactions in handling multi-word expressions. By combining these two approaches, the research aims to improve the precision of triplet extraction, as SE-GCN enhances syntactic understanding and the Span-Level Interaction Model ensures accurate sentiment relationship prediction. This combination is expected to outperform the EMC-GCN model, which primarily focuses on multi-channel graph structures without explicitly addressing span-level interactions. The study will use benchmark datasets like SemEval to evaluate the precision improvements achieved by the proposed model. \nKey Variables:\nSyntax-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (SE-GCN): SE-GCN integrates semantic and syntactic insights through graph convolution and attention mechanisms, enhancing the model's ability to capture language nuances. It refines word pair representations and aligns aspects with corresponding opinions, crucial for precise sentiment detection. SE-GCN is selected for its ability to incorporate syntactic dependencies and part-of-speech patterns, offering improved sentiment analysis accuracy. It directly influences the model's syntactic understanding, assessed through precision metrics on benchmark datasets.\nSpan-Level Interaction Model: This model explicitly considers interactions between complete spans of aspects and opinions to predict sentiment relationships, crucial for triplet extraction. It addresses limitations of word-pair interactions, improving accuracy in handling multi-word expressions. The model is chosen for its focus on span-level interactions, enhancing semantic consistency and contextual understanding. Its role is to ensure accurate sentiment relationship prediction, measured by precision improvements in triplet extraction tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the Syntax-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (SE-GCN) and the Span-Level Interaction Model. The SE-GCN will be responsible for capturing semantic and syntactic insights through graph convolution and attention mechanisms. This will involve using existing codeblocks for graph neural networks and attention mechanisms, adapted to integrate syntactic dependencies and part-of-speech patterns. The Span-Level Interaction Model will be implemented to focus on interactions between complete spans of aspects and opinions, using existing codeblocks for span-level interaction modeling. Data will flow from the input sentences through the SE-GCN to capture syntactic features, then through the Span-Level Interaction Model to ensure accurate sentiment relationship prediction. New logic will be built to integrate these components, ensuring seamless data flow and interaction between the models. The hypothesis will be realized by configuring the models to process benchmark datasets like SemEval, with outputs evaluated for precision improvements over the EMC-GCN model. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision, measuring the proportion of correctly identified aspect-sentiment-opinion triplets out of all identified triplets. This will be tested using benchmark datasets like SemEval, comparing the proposed model's precision against the EMC-GCN model. The control condition will be the EMC-GCN model's performance on the same datasets. Success will be interpreted as a statistically significant improvement in precision, with multiple runs to ensure reliability. Qualitative evaluations will involve analyzing specific examples where the proposed model outperforms the baseline, providing insights into the model's handling of complex multi-word expressions.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment to evaluate whether integrating a Syntax-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (SE-GCN) with a Span-Level Interaction Model improves precision in aspect sentiment triplet extraction, compared to an EMC-GCN baseline. The experiment should be implemented as a pilot study with three modes.\n\nGlobal Configuration:\n- Create a global PILOT_MODE variable that can be set to 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM operations\n- Load the SemEval dataset from Huggingface Hub\n\nData Processing:\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Use 10 sentences from the training set\n- Each sentence should contain at least one complex multi-word expression\nPILOT:\n- Use 100 sentences from training set for training\n- Use 50 sentences from validation set for evaluation\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n- Use full training set for training\n- Use full validation set for parameter tuning\n- Use full test set for final evaluation\n\nModel Implementation:\n1.

For each sentence:\n- Extract aspect-sentiment-opinion triplets\n- Calculate precision (correct triplets / total predicted triplets)\n- Log full extraction process and results\n\n2. Statistical Analysis:\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare baseline vs experimental precision\n- Report mean precision, standard deviation, and p-value\n- Generate precision comparison plots\n\nExecution Flow:\n1.

The structured feedback system actively solicits user engagement by presenting query outcomes and associated references directly to the user interface, collecting feedback that is cataloged and leveraged in subsequent training cycles. This ensures that user preferences and interaction patterns are continuously integrated into the model's training process. Semantic similarity scoring, implemented using a vector database constructed with the 'chroma' library, evaluates the contextual alignment of responses with user queries by measuring the closeness of response vectors to query vectors. By combining these two approaches, the hypothesis posits that the structured feedback system will provide continuous, user-driven improvements, while semantic similarity scoring ensures that responses remain contextually relevant. This dual approach addresses limitations in existing systems that rely solely on semantic similarity, which may not fully capture user preferences or adapt to evolving dialogue contexts. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in both response relevance and accuracy, leading to enhanced user satisfaction in customer service environments. \nKey Variables:\nStructured Feedback System: The structured feedback system actively engages users by presenting query outcomes and references directly on the user interface, collecting feedback that is used in subsequent training cycles. This system ensures continuous adaptation to user preferences and interaction patterns, promoting alignment with genuine user needs. It is selected for its ability to dynamically integrate user feedback into the model's training process, enhancing adaptability and optimization.\nSemantic Similarity Scoring: Semantic similarity scoring uses a vector database constructed with the 'chroma' library to measure the contextual alignment of responses with user queries. It employs distance scores to gauge relevance, filtering responses based on a predefined threshold. This method ensures that responses are contextually aligned with user queries, enhancing performance in real-world scenarios. It is chosen for its precision in maintaining response relevance.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating a structured feedback system with semantic similarity scoring. The structured feedback system will be developed to present query outcomes and references directly to the user interface, collecting feedback for use in subsequent training cycles. This will involve building a dynamic interaction component to align query outcomes with user prompts. Semantic similarity scoring will be implemented using a vector database constructed with the 'chroma' library, storing data in vector form for efficient query searches. The system will employ distance scores to gauge relevance, filtering responses based on a predefined threshold. The integration will involve creating a feedback loop where user feedback is continuously collected and used to refine the model's responses. The implementation will require building new modules for the structured feedback system and adapting existing codeblocks for semantic similarity scoring. Data will flow from user interactions to the feedback system, which will catalog and leverage feedback in training cycles, while semantic similarity scoring will ensure responses remain contextually relevant. The hypothesis will be realized by combining these components to enhance response relevance and accuracy in customer service dialogues. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be response relevance, measured using semantic similarity scores to assess the alignment of responses with user queries. Secondary metrics will include response accuracy, evaluated through precision and recall metrics, and user satisfaction, assessed through explicit ratings collected after each interaction. The hypothesis will be tested using a benchmark customer service dialogue dataset, with a control condition consisting of a system using semantic similarity scoring alone. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant increase in semantic similarity scores and precision/recall metrics, alongside higher user satisfaction ratings. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with qualitative assessments derived from user feedback on response quality.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to compare two dialogue response systems for customer service: a baseline system using semantic similarity scoring alone, and an experimental system that combines semantic similarity scoring with structured feedback.

Create a global variable PILOT_MODE that can be set to 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'\n2.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Dynamic Task Adaptation\nShort Description: Integrating dynamic task decomposition with memory augmentation to enhance adaptability and success in dynamic web environments.\nHypothesis to explore: Multimodal LLM-based agents utilizing dynamic task decomposition and memory augmentation will exhibit higher adaptability and task success rates in dynamic web environments compared to agents using static task decomposition, as measured by task success signals and adaptability metrics.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Utilization of dynamic task decomposition and memory augmentation\nDependent variable: Adaptability and task success rates\nComparison groups: Multimodal LLM-based agents vs. agents using static task decomposition\nBaseline/control: Agents using static task decomposition\nContext/setting: Dynamic web environments\nAssumptions: The adaptability and task success rates can be accurately measured by task success signals and adaptability metrics\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: LLM-based agents\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Task success signals and adaptability metrics\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the hypothesis that integrating dynamic task decomposition with memory augmentation can significantly enhance the adaptability and task success rates of multimodal LLM-based agents in dynamic web environments. Dynamic task decomposition involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks, allowing agents to adjust strategies based on the completion status of preceding tasks. Memory augmentation, on the other hand, involves replaying past action trajectories to inform current decision-making processes. By combining these techniques, the research aims to leverage the strengths of both methods: dynamic task decomposition provides flexibility and adaptability in handling complex tasks, while memory augmentation offers a historical context that can improve decision-making accuracy. This combination is expected to outperform static task decomposition methods, which lack the ability to adapt dynamically to changing environments. The research will be conducted using benchmarks like VisualWebArena, which simulate live web environments, providing a realistic setting for evaluating the proposed approach. The expected outcome is that agents using this integrated approach will demonstrate higher task success rates and adaptability metrics, providing a more robust solution for dynamic web task performance. \nKey Variables:\nDynamic Task Decomposition: Dynamic task decomposition involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks, which are then handled by specifically generated subagents. This approach enhances adaptability by allowing the system to dynamically adjust subsequent subtasks based on the completion status of preceding ones. The TDAG framework employs this method to improve the agent's performance in complex, multistep tasks by ensuring that each subtask is tailored to the current context. This method provides a nuanced evaluation of the agent's capabilities by capturing partial successes and enabling more effective problem-solving in dynamic environments.\nMemory Augmentation: Memory augmentation involves replaying past action trajectories to improve the agent's adaptability. This technique allows the agent to reflect on previous tasks and adjust its strategies accordingly. In the MMInA benchmark, this approach significantly enhances the agent's performance in multihop tasks by providing a flexible, model-agnostic method to incorporate historical data into decision-making processes. This augmentation helps the agent to better handle complex, real-world problem-solving scenarios by leveraging past experiences to inform current actions.\nTask Success Signal: Task success signal is used to evaluate the overall task success of web agents in environments like VisualWebArena. This signal is based on the environment's state and indicates whether the task was completed successfully. In practice, task success signal can be implemented by setting up a live environment where agents interact with different websites, and their actions are monitored to determine if they achieve the desired outcomes. The success signal is a binary indicator that provides immediate feedback on the agent's performance, allowing for quick adjustments and improvements in task execution strategies.\nAdaptability Metrics: Adaptability metrics involve testing the adaptability of web agents by assessing their performance on tasks from domains that were not part of the training set. In the AdaptAgent framework, this is implemented by using a test set that includes tasks from unseen domains, specifically 694 tasks from 2 unseen domains. The evaluation setup ensures that the agent's ability to generalize across different domains is measured, providing insights into its adaptability. This approach is crucial for understanding how well an agent can transfer learned skills to new, unencountered domains, which is a key aspect of adaptability in dynamic environments.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist, an end-to-end semi-automated scientific discovery system. The implementation will leverage dynamic task decomposition and memory augmentation techniques. Dynamic task decomposition will be realized using the TDAG framework, which breaks down complex tasks into smaller subtasks and generates subagents tailored to each subtask. This will involve creating a module that dynamically adjusts subtasks based on the completion status of preceding ones. Memory augmentation will be implemented by replaying past action trajectories, allowing the agent to reflect on previous tasks and adjust its strategies accordingly. This will require a module that stores and retrieves past action trajectories and integrates them into the decision-making process. The system will be tested using the VisualWebArena benchmark, which simulates live web environments. The agent's performance will be evaluated based on task success signals and adaptability metrics, which will be monitored and recorded throughout the experiments. The integration of these components will be achieved through a combination of existing codeblocks for task decomposition and memory management, along with newly built modules for dynamic adjustment and historical data integration. The expected outcome is that the agent will demonstrate higher task success rates and adaptability metrics compared to agents using static task decomposition. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be task success signals and adaptability metrics. Task success signals will be used to determine whether the agent successfully completes tasks in the VisualWebArena environment. This binary indicator will provide immediate feedback on the agent's performance. Adaptability metrics will assess the agent's ability to generalize across different domains, as measured by the percentage of tasks successfully completed in unseen domains. The evaluation will involve comparing the performance of agents using dynamic task decomposition and memory augmentation against those using static task decomposition. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher task success rate and adaptability metric for the proposed approach. The experiments will be conducted over multiple runs to ensure statistical reliability, and the results will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the integrated approach.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing two agent architectures in TextWorldExpress environments:\n\n1.

MEMIT CSK is designed to correct commonsense mistakes by modifying specific parameters in the early layers of language models, while LoRA efficiently updates model weights using low-rank approximations, minimizing computational overhead. The hypothesis posits that this combination will enhance the model's ability to maintain accurate commonsense knowledge, as measured by reliability and consistency metrics, compared to traditional baseline fine-tuning. This approach addresses the need for efficient and precise knowledge updates in language models, particularly for commonsense knowledge, which is often challenging to edit due to its contextual nature. By leveraging the strengths of MEMIT CSK and LoRA, this study aims to provide a more sustainable and consistent method for knowledge editing in language models, potentially offering a significant improvement over existing methods. \nKey Variables:\nEditing Method: MEMIT CSK and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are used to update commonsense knowledge in GPT-NEO. MEMIT CSK corrects commonsense mistakes by modifying specific parameters in early layers, while LoRA efficiently updates model weights using low-rank approximations. These methods are selected for their ability to provide precise and efficient updates, addressing the challenges of editing commonsense knowledge.\nModel Type: GPT-NEO is chosen for its open-source nature and ability to generate human-like text. The model will be modified using MEMIT CSK and LoRA to update its commonsense knowledge base. This model is suitable for the study due to its robust architecture and pre-trained capabilities, allowing for efficient integration of new information.\nKnowledge Type: Commonsense Knowledge involves general world knowledge that is not always explicitly stated but understood by humans. MEMIT CSK is particularly effective for this type of knowledge, focusing on early layers where commonsense knowledge is prevalent. The study aims to maintain coherence and plausibility in responses after edits.\nSustainability: Reliability and Consistency are the primary metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of the editing methods. Reliability measures the model's ability to accurately recall edited facts, while consistency assesses coherence across different contexts. These metrics ensure the sustainability of the knowledge update over time.\nEvaluation Period: A three-month evaluation period is chosen to assess the short-term effects of the editing methods. This period allows for rapid feedback and iteration, enabling researchers to refine the editing techniques and improve model consistency and knowledge retention.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for MEMIT CSK and LoRA. The GPT-NEO model will be used as the base model, with MEMIT CSK applied to correct commonsense mistakes by modifying specific parameters in early layers. LoRA will be used to update model weights using low-rank approximations, minimizing computational overhead. The experiment will involve setting up controlled tests to evaluate reliability and consistency metrics over a three-month period. Data will flow from the MEMIT CSK module to the LoRA module, with outputs evaluated using predefined metrics. New logic will be built to integrate these components, ensuring seamless data flow and accurate evaluation. The setup will include model configurations, input/output specifications, and evaluation protocols to ensure comprehensive testing of the hypothesis. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are reliability and consistency. Reliability will be measured by the model's ability to accurately recall edited commonsense knowledge, using a set of prompts directly querying the edited information. Consistency will be assessed by evaluating the model's responses across different contexts and queries related to the edited knowledge. The evaluation will involve a control condition using baseline fine-tuning, with comparative analysis conducted over a three-month period. Improvement will be interpreted as higher reliability and consistency scores compared to the baseline, with statistical confidence assessed through repeated testing and analysis.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether combining MEMIT CSK with LoRA improves commonsense knowledge editing in GPT-NEO. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), with the following specifications:\n\nPilot Modes:\n- MINI_PILOT: Test with 5 commonsense facts, 3 evaluation prompts per fact, running for 1 week\n- PILOT: Test with 20 commonsense facts, 5 evaluation prompts per fact, running for 2 weeks\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Test with 100 commonsense facts, 10 evaluation prompts per fact, running for three months\n\nCore Components:\n1.

The hypothesis is that this integration will enhance the model's precision in identifying and localizing objects based on linguistic descriptions without additional training. Depth maps and point clouds provide rich spatial measurement information, enabling more accurate spatial reasoning by enhancing the model's understanding of spatial attributes such as distance and orientation. SpatialVLM, designed to integrate visual and textual inputs, is particularly suited for this task as it can directly infer spatial relationships. The Open3DVQA benchmark, which focuses on predicting relative spatial positions in images, will be used to evaluate the model's performance. This approach addresses the limitations of current models that struggle with spatial measurements, offering a novel combination of techniques that have not been extensively explored in similar papers. By leveraging depth data and point clouds, the research aims to improve the precision of zero-shot tasks, providing a more comprehensive understanding of spatial relationships. \nKey Variables:\nDepth Maps and Point Clouds Integration: This variable represents the integration of depth maps and point clouds into the SpatialVLM model. The integration involves incorporating depth data into the vision encoder, enhancing the model's ability to reason about spatial attributes such as distance and length. This method requires pretraining on a self-generated dataset that includes depth information, allowing the model to better understand and predict spatial relations. The expected role of this variable is to provide a richer set of spatial cues to inform the model's reasoning process, directly influencing the precision of zero-shot referring expression comprehension tasks. The integration will be assessed by measuring the model's precision on the Open3DVQA benchmark, with improvements indicating successful enhancement of spatial reasoning capabilities.\nSpatialVLM: SpatialVLM is a vision-language model designed to integrate visual and textual inputs to directly infer spatial relationships. It addresses the challenge of predicting spatial relations by incorporating depth maps or point clouds. The model's architecture is tailored to enhance spatial reasoning capabilities by pretraining on a self-generated dataset with depth input. SpatialVLM's implementation involves using a plugin module for depth data integration, significantly improving spatial reasoning capacity. This model is particularly effective in tasks that require understanding 3D spatial arrangements and has been evaluated on benchmarks like Open3DVQA. The expected role of SpatialVLM in this research is to serve as the baseline model for integrating depth maps and point clouds, with its performance on zero-shot referring expression comprehension tasks being the primary focus of evaluation.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist's capabilities, focusing on integrating depth maps and point clouds with the SpatialVLM model. The existing codeblock for SpatialVLM will be utilized, which supports the integration of visual and textual inputs to infer spatial relationships. A new module will be built to handle the integration of depth maps and point clouds, enhancing the model's spatial reasoning capabilities. This module will preprocess depth data and point clouds, feeding them into the vision encoder of SpatialVLM. The Open3DVQA benchmark will be used for evaluation, providing a dataset that focuses on predicting relative spatial positions in images. The implementation will involve setting up the environment to process the benchmark dataset, configuring the model to accept depth data and point clouds, and running the zero-shot referring expression comprehension tasks. The outputs will be evaluated based on precision metrics, comparing the integrated model's performance against the baseline SpatialVLM without depth integration. This setup will allow for a comprehensive assessment of the hypothesis, leveraging CodeScientist's ability to automate experiment creation, execution, and analysis. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision, which measures the number of true positive results divided by the number of all positive results identified by the model. This metric is particularly relevant for zero-shot referring expression comprehension tasks, where accurately identifying the correct object among potential matches is crucial. The Open3DVQA benchmark will serve as the evaluation dataset, providing a challenging environment for testing spatial reasoning capabilities. The control condition will be the baseline SpatialVLM model without depth integration, allowing for a direct comparison of performance improvements. Success will be interpreted as a significant increase in precision, indicating enhanced spatial reasoning capabilities due to the integration of depth maps and point clouds. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with improvements in precision demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed integration.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate whether integrating depth information enhances spatial reasoning in language models.

The Copy-Generation Network leverages a type-copying vocabulary from a knowledge graph to enhance semantic type identification, while the Entity-Level Strategy provides demonstrations with clear entity boundary information to reduce ambiguity. By combining these techniques, the research aims to improve the model's ability to accurately type entities in zero-shot scenarios, where the model has not seen examples of the target entity types during training. The expected outcome is an improvement in precision and recall metrics, indicating a more accurate and comprehensive identification of entity types. This approach addresses the limitations of existing zero-shot entity typing models by enhancing the model's ability to leverage external knowledge and clear demonstrations, providing a more robust and effective solution for fine-grained entity typing. \nKey Variables:\nCopy-Generation Network: The Copy-Generation Network is implemented using a deep neural model called CopyFet, which integrates a copy mechanism into the entity typing process. This mechanism references a type-copying vocabulary from a knowledge graph, enhancing semantic type identification. The network operates by making type inferences from the entire type set while using the copy mechanism to identify semantic types with reference to the knowledge graph. This dual approach leverages rich typing information available in knowledge graphs, often neglected by other methods. The implementation involves training on benchmark datasets like FIGER (GOLD) and BBN, where CopyFet has demonstrated superior performance in accuracy metrics. The Copy-Generation Network is expected to improve the model's ability to predict entity types by providing additional semantic context and reducing label noise.\nEntity-Level Strategy: The Entity-Level Strategy involves using demonstrations that focus on clear entity boundary information and corresponding labeling. This strategy is effective at reducing entity boundary ambiguity and improving model performance on coarse-grained perturbations such as verbose and paraphrase. Implementation involves selecting examples that provide clear demarcations of entity boundaries, aiding in distinguishing entities from non-entities. This method enhances the model's ability to handle noisy data by providing consistent and clear examples of entity boundaries, thus improving robustness to noise. The strategy is implemented by selecting 10 examples from a clean data pool, which has been shown to result in the best performance on noisy test datasets. The Entity-Level Strategy is expected to improve the model's precision by reducing false positives and enhancing the clarity of entity boundaries.\nZero-Shot Prompt-Learning Framework: Zero-shot prompting involves structuring input data such that the model can infer entity types without prior examples of those types. This is achieved by designing prompts that include the context of the entity mention and a set of possible types. The framework uses pre-trained language models (PLMs) where the [CLS] token embedding is fed into an output layer to predict the probability distribution over the label space. The model parameters are optimized by maximizing the log probability of the correct type label across the dataset. This method allows the model to generalize to new entity types not seen during training, leveraging the inherent knowledge encoded in the PLM. The Zero-Shot Prompt-Learning Framework is expected to improve recall by enabling the model to identify a broader range of entity types, even those not encountered during training.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the following components: the Copy-Generation Network, the Entity-Level Strategy, and the Zero-Shot Prompt-Learning Framework. The Copy-Generation Network will be integrated into the prompt-learning framework to enhance semantic type identification by referencing a type-copying vocabulary from a knowledge graph. This will involve using the existing CopyFet model, which is trained on benchmark datasets like FIGER (GOLD) and BBN. The Entity-Level Strategy will be implemented by selecting 10 examples from a clean data pool to provide clear entity boundary information. This strategy will be integrated into the prompt-learning framework to reduce ambiguity and improve precision. The Zero-Shot Prompt-Learning Framework will be used to structure input data and design prompts that include the context of the entity mention and a set of possible types. The framework will leverage pre-trained language models to generalize to new entity types not seen during training. The integration of these components will involve adapting existing codeblocks for the Copy-Generation Network and Entity-Level Strategy, as well as building new logic to integrate these components into the zero-shot prompt-learning framework. The implementation will be tested on benchmark datasets to evaluate the impact on precision and recall metrics. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision and recall. Precision will measure the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model, specifically how many of the predicted entity types are correct. Recall will measure the model's ability to identify all relevant instances of an entity type, calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted types to the total number of actual types. The hypothesis will be tested using benchmark datasets like FIGER (GOLD) and BBN, with a control condition of the zero-shot prompt-learning framework without the Copy-Generation Network and Entity-Level Strategy. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher precision and recall compared to the control condition, indicating a more accurate and comprehensive identification of entity types. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment to test whether integrating a Copy-Generation Network with an Entity-Level Strategy in a zero-shot prompt-learning framework improves entity typing precision and recall. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable.\n\nCore Components:\n1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Hybrid Reasoning and Collaboration\nShort Description: Combining Tree-of-Thought Reasoning with Collaborative Mechanisms for SLMs to enhance smart home task performance.\nHypothesis to explore: A hybrid language model agent that combines Tree-of-Thought Reasoning with Collaborative Mechanisms for SLMs will achieve faster task completion and greater adaptability to environmental changes than standalone LLMs or SLMs in a VirtualHome simulated smart home environment.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Hybrid language model agent combining Tree-of-Thought Reasoning with Collaborative Mechanisms for SLMs\nDependent variable: Task completion speed and adaptability to environmental changes\nComparison groups: Hybrid language model agent vs. standalone LLMs or SLMs\nBaseline/control: Standalone LLMs or SLMs\nContext/setting: VirtualHome simulated smart home environment\nAssumptions: The hybrid model's mechanisms are effectively integrated and operational\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not explicitly stated, but implied to be tasks within a smart home environment\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Comparison of task completion speed and adaptability\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the potential of combining Tree-of-Thought (ToT) Reasoning with Collaborative Mechanisms for Small Language Models (SLMs) to enhance the performance of hybrid language model agents in a simulated smart home environment. The hypothesis posits that this integration will lead to faster task completion and improved adaptability to environmental changes compared to standalone LLMs or SLMs. Tree-of-Thought Reasoning allows the agent to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, increasing the diversity and accuracy of solutions. Collaborative Mechanisms for SLMs enable multiple models to work together, sharing insights and learning from each other's experiences, which enhances adaptability. The VirtualHome platform will be used to simulate a smart home environment, providing a controlled setting to evaluate the agent's performance. The expected outcome is that the hybrid agent will outperform standalone models in terms of task completion time and adaptability, demonstrating the synergistic benefits of combining ToT Reasoning with collaborative mechanisms. This research addresses gaps in existing literature by exploring a novel combination of reasoning and collaboration techniques, offering insights into the development of more efficient and adaptable AI agents. \nKey Variables:\nTree-of-Thought Reasoning: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) Reasoning structures the reasoning process in a tree-like format, allowing the model to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. Each node represents a potential reasoning path, enabling the model to consider various possibilities before arriving at a conclusion. This approach is particularly effective in scenarios where multiple solutions are possible. In this research, ToT Reasoning will be implemented using GPT-4, which can handle complex reasoning structures. The effectiveness of ToT Reasoning will be assessed by measuring the diversity and accuracy of solutions generated by the model. This technique was selected for its ability to enhance logical reasoning and improve the model's problem-solving capabilities.\nCollaborative Mechanisms for SLMs: Collaborative Mechanisms for Small Language Models (SLMs) involve multiple models working together to solve complex tasks. This can be implemented through ensemble learning or swarm intelligence frameworks, where SLMs share insights and learn from each other's experiences. In this research, collaborative mechanisms will be facilitated by a central controller that coordinates the models' actions and integrates their outputs. The performance of these mechanisms will be evaluated by their ability to handle tasks beyond the capability of individual models, demonstrating improved adaptability and problem-solving skills. This approach was chosen for its potential to enhance the adaptability of SLMs by leveraging collective intelligence.\nVirtualHome Platform: VirtualHome is a simulation platform used to create smart home environments for testing AI agents. It provides a comprehensive setup with various smart home devices and scenarios, enabling the evaluation of agents' problem-solving capabilities. In this research, VirtualHome will be used to simulate a smart home environment, allowing for the customization of task complexity and the number of devices involved. This platform supports the integration of LLMs and SLMs, facilitating the testing of hybrid models in multi-step problem-solving tasks. The choice of VirtualHome is based on its flexibility in scenario creation and device configuration, making it an ideal choice for simulating smart home environments.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks and building new components as needed. The Tree-of-Thought Reasoning will be implemented using the GPT-4 model, which will be integrated into the system to handle complex reasoning tasks. The Collaborative Mechanisms for SLMs will be facilitated by a central controller, which will coordinate the actions of multiple SLMs and integrate their outputs. The VirtualHome platform will be used to simulate the smart home environment, providing a controlled setting for testing the agent's performance. The implementation will involve setting up the VirtualHome environment with various smart home devices and scenarios, configuring the GPT-4 model for ToT Reasoning, and integrating the collaborative mechanisms for SLMs. The system will be tested by running multiple scenarios in the VirtualHome environment, measuring task completion time and adaptability to environmental changes. The data will be collected and analyzed to evaluate the performance of the hybrid agent compared to standalone models. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be task completion time and adaptability to environmental changes. Task completion time will be measured by the time taken by the agent to complete a given task in the VirtualHome environment. Adaptability will be assessed by the agent's ability to adjust its strategies and actions in response to changes in the environment. The control condition will involve standalone LLMs and SLMs, allowing for a comparative analysis of the hybrid agent's performance. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant reduction in task completion time and increased adaptability compared to the control condition. The evaluation will involve multiple runs of each scenario to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing a baseline ReAct agent against a hybrid Tree-of-Thought (ToT) collaborative agent in CookingWorld (from TextWorldExpress).

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Dialect-Enhanced Arabic Generation\nShort Description: Combining dialect-specific pretraining with dialect-aware embeddings to enhance Arabic text generation.\nHypothesis to explore: An Arabic language model that combines dialect-specific pretraining with dialect-aware embedding models will achieve higher BLEU scores and cultural awareness evaluation compared to models using only dialect-specific pretraining, in text generation tasks involving Gulf, Levant, and Egyptian dialects.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Combination of dialect-specific pretraining with dialect-aware embedding models\nDependent variable: Higher BLEU scores and cultural awareness evaluation\nComparison groups: Models combining dialect-specific pretraining with dialect-aware embedding models vs. models using only dialect-specific pretraining\nBaseline/control: Models using only dialect-specific pretraining\nContext/setting: Text generation tasks involving Gulf, Levant, and Egyptian dialects\nAssumptions: The combination of pretraining and embedding models will enhance performance\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Arabic language models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: BLEU scores and cultural awareness evaluation\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to evaluate the impact of combining dialect-specific pretraining with dialect-aware embedding models on the performance of Arabic language models in text generation tasks. The hypothesis posits that this combination will lead to higher BLEU scores and improved cultural awareness evaluation compared to using dialect-specific pretraining alone. Dialect-specific pretraining involves training language models on datasets exclusively composed of text from a particular dialect, ensuring that the model learns the unique linguistic features and nuances of the target dialect. Dialect-aware embedding models are designed to capture the linguistic diversity of Arabic dialects by incorporating dialect-specific features into the embeddings. These models prioritize the inclusion of low-resource dialects and ensure that the synthetic data generation pipeline accounts for dialectal diversity. The combination of these techniques is expected to enhance the model's ability to generate contextually appropriate responses and improve its performance in tasks that require a deep understanding of regional dialects and cultural contexts. This research addresses the gap in existing literature by exploring a novel combination of techniques that have not been extensively tested together, providing insights into the potential synergies between dialect-specific pretraining and dialect-aware embeddings. \nKey Variables:\nDialect-Specific Pretraining: Dialect-specific pretraining involves training language models on datasets exclusively composed of text from a particular dialect, such as Gulf, Levant, or Egyptian Arabic. This approach ensures that the model learns the unique linguistic features and nuances of the target dialect. Pretraining on dialect-specific data can improve the model's performance in tasks like dialect identification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. The success of this approach depends on the availability of comprehensive and high-quality dialect-specific datasets.\nDialect-Aware Embedding Models: Dialect-aware embedding models are designed to capture the linguistic diversity of Arabic dialects by incorporating dialect-specific features into the embeddings. These models prioritize the inclusion of low-resource dialects and ensure that the synthetic data generation pipeline accounts for dialectal diversity. The implementation involves training embedding models on datasets that represent a wide range of dialects, allowing the model to learn the unique linguistic features of each dialect. This approach enhances the model's ability to understand and generate contextually appropriate responses across different dialects, making it a valuable tool for improving contextual understanding in Arabic NLP tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate dialect-specific pretraining with dialect-aware embedding models. The experiment will utilize existing codeblocks for pretraining language models on dialect-specific datasets, ensuring that the model learns the unique linguistic features of Gulf, Levant, and Egyptian dialects. Dialect-aware embedding models will be built by incorporating dialect-specific features into the embeddings, prioritizing the inclusion of low-resource dialects. The implementation will involve training embedding models on datasets that represent a wide range of dialects, allowing the model to learn the unique linguistic features of each dialect. The integration of these techniques will be facilitated by developing a glue module that combines the outputs of the pretraining and embedding models, ensuring that the model can generate contextually appropriate responses. The experiment will be evaluated using BLEU scores and cultural awareness evaluation, comparing the performance of the combined model against a baseline model using only dialect-specific pretraining. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be BLEU scores and cultural awareness evaluation. BLEU scores will be used to assess the quality of text generated by the model, measuring how semantically and syntactically similar the generated text is to human-produced text. Cultural awareness evaluation will assess the model's ability to understand and generate text that is culturally relevant and appropriate for different Arabic-speaking regions. The experiment will involve testing the model on text generation tasks involving Gulf, Levant, and Egyptian dialects, comparing the performance of the combined model against a baseline model using only dialect-specific pretraining. Success will be interpreted as a statistically significant improvement in BLEU scores and cultural awareness evaluation for the combined model.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate whether combining dialect-specific pretraining with dialect-aware embeddings improves Arabic text generation. The experiment should be implemented as follows:\n\n1. EXPERIMENT MODES:\nImplement a global PILOT_MODE variable with three settings:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 text generation examples per dialect (Gulf, Levant, Egyptian), 30 total examples\n- PILOT: Use 100 text generation examples per dialect, 300 total examples\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use 1000 text generation examples per dialect, 3000 total examples\n\n2. DATA PREPARATION:\n- Use the Huggingface Hub API to source Arabic dialect datasets for Gulf, Levant, and Egyptian Arabic\n- For each dialect, create a test set of parallel sentences (original text and human-generated reference translation)\n- Split the data into train/dev/test sets (60/20/20)\n\n3. MODEL SETUP:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini as the base model for all experiments\n- Baseline Condition: Fine-tune on dialect-specific data only\n- Experimental Condition: Fine-tune on dialect-specific data AND incorporate dialect-aware embeddings\n\n4. EVALUATION PIPELINE:\n- For each test example:\n  a) Present the input text to both baseline and experimental models\n  b) Generate translations using both models\n  c) Calculate BLEU score against reference translations\n  d) Calculate cultural awareness score using gpt-4o-mini as evaluator\n\n5. CULTURAL AWARENESS EVALUATION:\n- For each generated text, use gpt-4o-mini to rate cultural appropriateness on a scale of 1-5\n- Prompt template for cultural evaluation:\n  'Rate the cultural appropriateness of this Arabic text for the [DIALECT] dialect on a scale of 1-5, where:\\n1 = Completely inappropriate/incorrect for the dialect\\n2 = Several cultural/dialectal errors\\n3 = Some minor cultural/dialectal inconsistencies\\n4 = Generally appropriate with very minor issues\\n5 = Perfectly appropriate for the dialect\\n\\nText: [GENERATED_TEXT]\\n\\nPlease output only the numeric score.'\n\n6. ANALYSIS:\n- Calculate mean BLEU scores and cultural awareness scores for each condition\n- Use bootstrap resampling to test for significant differences between conditions\n- Generate summary statistics for each dialect separately and combined\n\n7. LOGGING AND REPORTING:\n- Log all model outputs, scores, and statistical analyses\n- For each example, log:\n  * Original text\n  * Generated text (both conditions)\n  * BLEU scores\n  * Cultural awareness scores\n  * Time taken\n\n8. EXECUTION ORDER:\n- Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n- If successful, proceed to PILOT mode\n- Stop after PILOT mode (await human verification before FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n\nPlease implement appropriate error handling and logging throughout. Report progress at regular intervals. Generate a final summary report comparing baseline and experimental conditions across all metrics. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

VCD aims to reduce hallucinations by contrasting outputs from original and distorted visual inputs, introducing visual uncertainty to identify over-reliance on language priors. RITUAL complements this by using randomly transformed images as additional inputs, diversifying visual perspectives and correcting misinterpretations. The hypothesis posits that combining these methods will enhance the model's ability to discern real objects from hallucinated ones, leveraging the strengths of both techniques. The POPE metric will be used to evaluate the model's performance in recognizing object presence or absence, using the COCO dataset for a comprehensive assessment. This approach addresses gaps in existing methods by focusing on visual input diversity and contrast, offering a novel solution to reduce hallucinations without additional training or external models. \nKey Variables:\nVisual Contrastive Decoding (VCD): VCD is a technique that contrasts outputs from original and distorted visual inputs to reduce hallucinations. It introduces visual uncertainty, such as Gaussian noise, to identify and mitigate over-reliance on language priors. Implemented by adjusting attention weights based on prediction differences, VCD encourages reliance on visual information. This method is chosen for its computational efficiency and effectiveness in scenarios with dataset biases. It directly influences the model's ability to differentiate between hallucinated and relevant tokens, assessed through changes in attention patterns and output consistency.\nRandom Image Transformations (RITUAL): RITUAL uses randomly transformed images as complementary inputs during decoding to adjust output probability distributions. It exposes the model to diverse visual perspectives, correcting misinterpretations leading to hallucinations. This method is implemented by integrating probability distributions from original and transformed images, without additional training. RITUAL's novelty lies in its self-adaptive approach, ensuring consistent performance across scenarios. It enhances the model's visual fidelity, measured by improvements in object recognition accuracy using the POPE metric.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) and Random Image Transformations (RITUAL) into a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). Existing codeblocks will handle the model's basic operations, while new modules will be built to apply VCD and RITUAL. The VCD module will introduce Gaussian noise to input images and compare outputs to adjust attention weights, leveraging existing contrastive decoding codeblocks. The RITUAL module will generate random transformations of input images, integrating their probability distributions with the original image outputs. Data will flow from image input through transformation and decoding modules, with outputs evaluated using the POPE metric. This setup will be tested on the COCO dataset, with the hypothesis realized through iterative experimentation and analysis by CodeScientist. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric is the POPE metric, which evaluates the model's ability to correctly identify object presence or absence in images. This binary object recognition metric will be applied to the COCO dataset, providing a clear measure of hallucination reduction. Success will be indicated by a significant reduction in false positives and negatives compared to baseline models. Secondary metrics include attention pattern consistency and output stability across transformed inputs, assessed through comparative analysis of attention maps and output variance. Improvement will be interpreted through statistical analysis of POPE scores across multiple runs, ensuring robustness and reliability.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) and Random Image Transformations (RITUAL) in reducing object hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).\n\nExperimental Setup:\n1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Cross-Attention Module Integration\nShort Description: Integrating cross-attention with parameter-efficient modules to enhance NLP model precision and efficiency.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating cross-attention for information fusion with parameter-efficient module insertion in NLP models will improve precision and reduce computational cost compared to HINT, as measured on the GLUE benchmark dataset.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating cross-attention for information fusion with parameter-efficient module insertion\nDependent variable: Precision and computational cost\nComparison groups: NLP models with and without the integration\nBaseline/control: HINT\nContext/setting: NLP models evaluated on the GLUE benchmark dataset\nAssumptions: The integration will lead to improvements\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: NLP models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Measured on the GLUE benchmark dataset\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of cross-attention for information fusion with parameter-efficient module insertion in NLP models to enhance performance on the GLUE benchmark. The hypothesis posits that combining these techniques will improve precision and reduce computational costs compared to the HINT baseline. Cross-attention mechanisms enable effective fusion of task instructions and input data, ensuring contextually relevant outputs. Parameter-efficient modules, generated by hypernetworks, allow dynamic task-specific model adaptation with minimal computational overhead. This integration leverages the strengths of both techniques: cross-attention enhances the model's ability to focus on pertinent information, while parameter-efficient modules ensure lightweight and adaptable task handling. The expected outcome is a model that performs better in precision metrics while maintaining or reducing computational costs. This approach addresses gaps in existing literature by combining two powerful techniques that have not been extensively tested together, offering a novel method for improving NLP model efficiency and performance. \nKey Variables:\nCross-Attention for Information Fusion: Cross-attention mechanisms are used to enhance the integration of task instructions with input data, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of both. This technique is implemented by incorporating cross-attention layers that align encoded instructions with input representations. The choice of cross-attention is motivated by its ability to improve contextual understanding and output relevance, particularly in scenarios requiring complex task generalization. The expected outcome is improved precision in task performance, as the model can better capture task-specific nuances.\nParameter-Efficient Module Insertion: Parameter-efficient modules are dynamically generated by hypernetworks based on encoded task instructions. These modules are inserted into the underlying model to adapt it for specific tasks without significant computational cost. This approach is selected for its ability to maintain high performance across diverse tasks while minimizing resource usage. The modules are designed to be lightweight, ensuring that the model can handle various tasks efficiently. The expected role of this variable is to reduce computational costs while maintaining or enhancing model performance.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate cross-attention mechanisms with parameter-efficient module insertion in an NLP model. The existing codeblock for hypernetwork-based encoding will be adapted to include cross-attention layers. The process involves encoding task instructions and input data separately, followed by cross-attention to align these representations. Parameter-efficient modules are then generated by the hypernetwork and inserted into the model. The GLUE benchmark dataset will be used for evaluation, with precision and computational cost as primary metrics. The implementation will require building new codeblocks for cross-attention integration and adapting existing hypernetwork modules. Data flows from instruction encoding to cross-attention alignment, followed by module generation and insertion. The model's performance will be compared against the HINT baseline, focusing on precision improvements and computational cost reduction. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is precision, which measures the accuracy of positive predictions made by the model. Precision will be calculated using a confusion matrix to determine true positives and false positives. The secondary metric is computational cost, assessed by measuring the FLOPs required for model inference. The GLUE benchmark will serve as the evaluation dataset, providing a diverse set of tasks to test model performance. Success will be interpreted as a significant improvement in precision and a reduction in computational cost compared to the HINT baseline. Multiple runs will be conducted to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a comparative experiment between a baseline HINT model and our proposed cross-attention integration model on the GLUE benchmark dataset.

MAGA leverages a graph attention mechanism to model interactions among agents, allowing them to focus on relevant information and improve cooperation efficiency. DialCoT decomposes complex questions into sub-questions in a dialogue format, guiding the model through a structured reasoning process. By combining these techniques, the system is expected to maintain logical coherence across multiple reasoning steps, addressing the challenge of disconnected reasoning often seen in multi-hop QA tasks. The integration aims to ensure that each agent's contribution is optimally aligned with the overall reasoning path, thereby enhancing the system's ability to handle complex questions. This approach is novel as it combines structured agent communication with a dialogue-based decomposition method, which has not been extensively explored in similar studies. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in reasoning consistency, evaluated through benchmarks like HotpotQA, where the system's logical coherence and accuracy in answering complex questions will be assessed. \nKey Variables:\nMulti-Agent Graph Attention: Multi-Agent Graph Attention (MAGA) employs a graph attention mechanism to model interactions among agents, enhancing coordination and information flow. In this experiment, MAGA will be configured to allow agents to selectively focus on relevant information, improving cooperation efficiency. This is achieved by defining intentions and parameters for each agent, enabling formal coherence checks during interactions. MAGA is selected for its ability to enhance alignment and coordination among agents, directly influencing reasoning consistency by ensuring effective information flow. The expected role of MAGA is to facilitate structured communication, allowing agents to contribute meaningfully to the reasoning process. This will be assessed by evaluating the system's ability to maintain logical coherence across reasoning steps, with success indicated by improved reasoning consistency metrics.\nDialogue-Guided Chain-of-Thought: Dialogue-Guided Chain-of-Thought (DialCoT) is a question decomposition technique that structures reasoning into a dialogue format. It involves two roles: the Decomposer, which breaks down complex questions into simpler sub-questions, and the Solver, which answers these sub-questions sequentially. DialCoT is implemented by designing distinct instructions for the Decomposer and Solver, followed by tuning to optimize their interaction. This method is chosen for its ability to guide the model through a structured reasoning process, enhancing interpretability and robustness. The expected role of DialCoT is to improve reasoning consistency by ensuring that each reasoning step logically follows the previous one, which will be evaluated by the system's ability to accurately answer decomposed sub-questions and aggregate information to solve the original question.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate Multi-Agent Graph Attention (MAGA) with Dialogue-Guided Chain-of-Thought (DialCoT). Existing codeblocks for MAGA will be used to establish agent interactions through a graph attention mechanism, allowing agents to focus on relevant information. DialCoT will be implemented by designing dialogue-based prompts for question decomposition, with distinct roles for the Decomposer and Solver. The data flow involves agents using MAGA to coordinate and share information, while DialCoT guides the reasoning process through structured dialogue. New logic will be built to integrate these components, ensuring seamless communication and reasoning flow. Inputs will include complex multi-hop questions, and outputs will be evaluated based on reasoning consistency and accuracy. The implementation will involve setting up agent roles, configuring graph attention parameters, and designing dialogue prompts, with the goal of realizing the hypothesis end-to-end in code. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be reasoning consistency, measured by the system's ability to maintain logical coherence across reasoning steps. This will be assessed using benchmarks like HotpotQA, where the system's reasoning paths will be analyzed for logical consistency and alignment with expected sequences. Secondary metrics include accuracy in answering complex questions and the number of valid reasoning steps. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant increase in reasoning consistency and accuracy compared to baseline systems without the integrated approach. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with success indicated by consistent performance improvements across these metrics.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing baseline vs experimental approaches to multi-hop question answering using the HotpotQA dataset. The experiment should be configurable with a PILOT_MODE variable that can be set to 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'.\n\nDataset Setup:\n1.

Tree-of-Thought prompting allows language models to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, enhancing interpretability and decision-making in complex tasks. Domain-enhanced prompts incorporate domain-specific knowledge, providing the model with contextually relevant information that can improve task performance. By integrating these two techniques, the study aims to leverage the strengths of both interpretability and domain knowledge to enhance model accuracy and robustness. The hypothesis posits that this combination will outperform manual prompt design, which lacks the systematic exploration of reasoning paths and domain-specific contextualization. This research addresses the gap in existing literature by testing a novel combination of prompting techniques, potentially offering a more effective approach for few-shot learning scenarios where data is limited. \nKey Variables:\nTree-of-Thought (ToT) Prompting: Tree-of-Thought prompting is a technique that structures prompts in a branching manner, allowing the model to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. This method enhances interpretability by providing a comprehensive view of the model's decision-making process. In this experiment, ToT prompting will be implemented by designing prompts that branch into different logical paths, each representing a hypothesis or reasoning step. This approach is expected to improve the model's ability to consider various possibilities before arriving at a conclusion, thereby enhancing its reasoning capabilities.\nDomain-Enhanced Prompts: Domain-enhanced prompts incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the prompt design, improving model performance by providing contextually relevant information. In this experiment, prompts will be crafted to include domain-specific terms and context, enabling the model to leverage task-specific information effectively. This approach is expected to enhance the semantic relevance of the prompts, guiding the model more effectively in understanding and performing the task. The combination of domain-enhanced prompts with ToT prompting is hypothesized to result in a more robust and accurate model performance.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to design and evaluate experiments. The experiment will involve setting up a few-shot text classification task using a dataset relevant to the chosen domain. Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting will be implemented by structuring prompts in a branching manner, allowing the model to explore multiple reasoning paths. Domain-enhanced prompts will be crafted by incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the prompts. The experiment will compare the performance of the model using ToT prompting with domain-enhanced prompts against a baseline using manual prompt design. The F1-score will be used as the primary metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the prompting techniques. CodeScientist will automate the experiment setup, execution, and analysis, ensuring reproducibility and accuracy in the results. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the F1-score, which balances precision and recall, providing a comprehensive measure of model performance in classification tasks. The experiment will compare the F1-score of models using Tree-of-Thought prompting with domain-enhanced prompts against those using manual prompt design. A higher F1-score in the experimental setup will indicate improved model performance. The experiment will be conducted over multiple runs to ensure statistical significance, and results will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the proposed prompting techniques.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting with domain-enhanced prompts against a baseline manual prompt design for few-shot text classification. The experiment should be implemented as follows:\n\n1. Dataset:\n- Use the Huggingface Hub API to load the 'ag_news' dataset (a news article classification dataset with 4 categories: World, Sports, Business, Science/Tech)\n- For MINI_PILOT: Use 10 examples from the training set for few-shot learning, and evaluate on 20 different examples\n- For PILOT: Use 50 examples for few-shot learning, evaluate on 100 examples from validation set\n- For FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use 200 examples for few-shot learning, evaluate on full test set\n\n2. Baseline Implementation (Manual Prompt):\n- Create a basic few-shot prompt template: 'Here are some examples of news article classification:\\n[EXAMPLES]\\n\\nNow classify this article into one of these categories (World, Sports, Business, Science/Tech):\\n[INPUT]\\n\\nCategory:'\n- The examples section should show the text and correct category for each few-shot example\n\n3. Experimental Implementation (ToT + Domain):\n- First, enhance the domain knowledge by adding category descriptions:\n  * World: International news, politics, conflicts, diplomacy, global events\n  * Sports: Athletics, games, tournaments, sports news, athletes\n  * Business: Commerce, economy, markets, companies, financial news\n  * Science/Tech: Scientific discoveries, technology news, innovations\n- Implement ToT by breaking classification into steps:\n  Step 1: 'What are the key topics or themes in this article?'\n  Step 2: 'How do these topics relate to our category definitions?'\n  Step 3: 'Which category best matches based on this analysis?'\n\n4. Evaluation Process:\n- For each test example:\n  * Run baseline prompt through gpt-4o-mini\n  * Run experimental prompt through gpt-4o-mini\n  * Calculate F1-score for each approach\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare F1-scores between approaches\n\n5. Logging Requirements:\n- Log all prompts generated\n- Log all responses from the LLM\n- Log individual classification results and F1-scores\n- For ToT, log the intermediate reasoning steps\n\n6. Output Requirements:\n- Generate a results file containing:\n  * Overall F1-scores for both approaches\n  * Bootstrap comparison results\n  * Example classifications showing the difference in reasoning between approaches\n\nPlease implement this as a pilot experiment with three modes (PILOT_MODE variable):\nMINI_PILOT: 10 few-shot examples, 20 test examples, training set only\nPILOT: 50 few-shot examples, 100 validation examples\nFULL_EXPERIMENT: 200 few-shot examples, full test set\n\nStart with MINI_PILOT. If successful, proceed to PILOT, then stop (do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT).\n\nUse gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls as specified in the conditioning instructions. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Dynamic Low-Rank Activation\nShort Description: Integrating dynamic submodule activation with low-rank decomposition to enhance model performance on diverse tasks.\nHypothesis to explore: Dynamic submodule activation combined with low-rank decomposition will improve accuracy and adaptability on the GLUE benchmark and SummZoo datasets compared to using either method alone.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Dynamic submodule activation combined with low-rank decomposition\nDependent variable: Accuracy and adaptability\nComparison groups: Combined method vs. either method alone\nBaseline/control: Using either dynamic submodule activation or low-rank decomposition alone\nContext/setting: GLUE benchmark and SummZoo datasets\nAssumptions: The methods can be effectively combined and measured on the specified datasets\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not specified\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Performance on GLUE benchmark and SummZoo datasets\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of dynamic submodule activation with low-rank decomposition to enhance the performance of large pre-trained language models on the GLUE benchmark and SummZoo datasets. Dynamic submodule activation allows the model to adaptively select the most suitable parameter-efficient tuning method based on task requirements, optimizing the use of adapters and prefix-tuning. Low-rank decomposition further reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximating weight matrices with low-rank matrices, maintaining model performance while minimizing computational costs. By combining these techniques, the research aims to exploit their complementary strengths: dynamic submodule activation's adaptability and low-rank decomposition's efficiency. This combination is expected to outperform the individual methods by improving both accuracy and adaptability across diverse tasks, addressing the limitations of existing parameter-efficient tuning methods that often focus on either adaptability or efficiency in isolation. \nKey Variables:\nDynamic Submodule Activation: Dynamic submodule activation involves integrating various parameter-efficient tuning methods as submodules and learning to activate them based on task requirements. This is achieved using a control mechanism that evaluates the current data or task setup and selects the most appropriate submodule to activate. This approach leverages the flexibility of adapters and prefix-tuning, allowing the model to dynamically switch between different tuning strategies without manual intervention. It reduces the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and enables efficient adaptation to diverse tasks.\nLow-Rank Decomposition: Low-rank decomposition approximates the weight matrices of a pre-trained model using low-rank matrices, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. This technique focuses on the most informative components of the weight matrices, decomposing them into smaller matrices for fine-tuning. It is particularly effective in scenarios with limited computational resources, maintaining model performance while reducing memory footprint. The rank parameter is carefully selected to balance efficiency and performance.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate dynamic submodule activation with low-rank decomposition in a large pre-trained language model. Existing codeblocks for dynamic submodule activation will be adapted to include a control mechanism that evaluates task requirements and activates the appropriate submodule. Low-rank decomposition will be implemented by decomposing weight matrices into low-rank matrices, using existing libraries for matrix operations. Data from the GLUE benchmark and SummZoo datasets will be processed using standard data handling codeblocks. The model's performance will be evaluated on these datasets, with accuracy and adaptability as primary metrics. A new integration layer will be built to manage the interaction between dynamic submodule activation and low-rank decomposition, ensuring seamless data flow and parameter updates. The setup will involve configuring the model with pre-trained weights, setting up the control mechanism for submodule activation, and applying low-rank decomposition to the weight matrices. Outputs will be analyzed to assess improvements in accuracy and adaptability compared to baseline methods. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are accuracy and adaptability. Accuracy will be measured using the F1 Score on the GLUE benchmark and ROUGE Score on the SummZoo datasets. Adaptability will be assessed by the model's performance across diverse tasks within these datasets, using precision and recall metrics. Baseline comparisons will involve models using only dynamic submodule activation or low-rank decomposition. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in F1 and ROUGE scores, with adaptability indicated by consistent performance across tasks. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure reliability, with statistical tests applied to confirm significance.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to evaluate the combination of dynamic submodule activation and low-rank decomposition in language models. The experiment should use gpt-4o-mini as the base model.\n\nGlobal Configuration:\nCreate a PILOT_MODE variable that can be set to 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'. The implementation should:\n- For MINI_PILOT: Use 2 tasks from GLUE (e.g., MNLI, QQP) and 1 from SummZoo, with 10 examples per task\n- For PILOT: Use 4 tasks from GLUE and 2 from SummZoo, with 100 examples per task\n- For FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use all GLUE tasks and SummZoo tasks, with full datasets\n\nImplement three conditions:\n1. Baseline 1: Dynamic submodule activation only\n2. Baseline 2: Low-rank decomposition only\n3. Experimental: Combined approach\n\nFor each condition:\n1. Initialize gpt-4o-mini with the appropriate configuration\n2. For the dynamic submodule condition, implement a control mechanism that selects between adapter tuning and prefix tuning based on task type\n3. For the low-rank condition, implement matrix decomposition with rank=8 for MINI_PILOT, rank=32 for PILOT, and rank=128 for FULL_EXPERIMENT\n4. For the combined condition, integrate both approaches\n\nDataset Processing:\n1. Use the Huggingface Datasets API to load GLUE and SummZoo datasets\n2. For each task, create train/dev splits appropriate to the PILOT_MODE\n3. Log the number of examples and basic statistics for each dataset\n\nEvaluation:\n1. For each condition and task:\n   - Record accuracy (F1 for GLUE, ROUGE for SummZoo)\n   - Record inference time\n   - Log full prediction outputs\n2. Calculate adaptability score as the coefficient of variation (lower is better) across task performances\n\nVisualization:\n1. Create line plots showing:\n   - Performance across tasks for each condition\n   - Adaptability scores\n   - Inference time comparisons\n\nStatistical Analysis:\n1. Use bootstrap resampling to compare:\n   - Performance differences between conditions\n   - Adaptability differences between conditions\n2. Apply Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. Generate a results.json file containing:\n   - Raw performance metrics\n   - Statistical test results\n   - Adaptability scores\n2. Generate PDF plots of all visualizations\n3. Create a detailed log file with:\n   - Full configuration details\n   - All intermediate results\n   - Any errors or warnings\n\nRun the experiment in this order:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT\n3. Stop after PILOT (do not proceed to FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n\nReport any errors, warnings, or unexpected behaviors in the log file. Include timing information for each major step of the experiment. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: MIP and Counterfactual Memorization Integration\nShort Description: Combining masked identifier prediction with counterfactual memorization to enhance code model performance and reduce memorization.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating masked identifier prediction with counterfactual memorization techniques will enhance code model performance in generation tasks, as measured by BLEU scores, while reducing memorization, as quantified by the frequency of memorized outputs.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating masked identifier prediction with counterfactual memorization techniques\nDependent variable: Code model performance in generation tasks, memorization\nComparison groups: Not explicitly mentioned\nBaseline/control: Not explicitly mentioned\nContext/setting: Code model generation tasks\nAssumptions: Not explicitly mentioned\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Code models\nTimeframe: Not explicitly mentioned\nMeasurement method: BLEU scores for performance, frequency of memorized outputs for memorization\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to explore the synergy between masked identifier prediction (MIP) and counterfactual memorization techniques in improving the performance of code models in generation tasks. MIP focuses on enhancing the semantic understanding of code by masking identifiers and training the model to predict them, which is crucial for tasks like defect detection and code completion. Counterfactual memorization, on the other hand, helps in distinguishing between memorized and generalized outputs by comparing model outputs with those from a control model trained on a different dataset. By combining these techniques, the hypothesis posits that the model will not only perform better in generating syntactically and semantically accurate code but also exhibit reduced memorization of training data. This approach addresses the dual challenge of improving model performance while mitigating the risks associated with memorization, such as data leakage and overfitting. The expected outcome is a more robust code model that can generalize better across different programming tasks, thereby filling a gap in existing literature where these techniques have been explored in isolation but not in combination. \nKey Variables:\nMasked Identifier Prediction: Masked Identifier Prediction (MIP) is a pre-training task where identifiers in the code are masked, and the model learns to predict them. This task enhances the model's semantic understanding of code. In this experiment, MIP will be implemented using a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, focusing on the semantic relationships between code components. The choice of MIP is due to its proven effectiveness in improving code completion and defect detection tasks. The expected role of MIP is to improve the model's ability to understand and generate semantically correct code. The success of MIP will be measured by improvements in BLEU scores on code generation tasks.\nCounterfactual Memorization: Counterfactual memorization is a technique to assess whether a model's output is due to memorization or genuine understanding. This involves comparing model outputs with a control model trained on separate data. The implementation will use a fixed control model, such as FT.2, which was not trained on the same dataset as the model under inspection. The goal is to reduce the frequency of memorized outputs, thereby improving generalization. The effectiveness of this technique will be measured by the reduction in the frequency of outputs that match training data.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate masked identifier prediction (MIP) and counterfactual memorization techniques. The experiment will use a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture to implement MIP, where identifiers in the code are masked, and the model learns to predict them. This will be achieved using existing codeblocks for transformer models and data preprocessing. For counterfactual memorization, a control model, such as FT.2, will be employed to compare outputs and identify memorized content. The experiment will involve training the model on a dataset with MIP and evaluating its performance on code generation tasks using BLEU scores. The frequency of memorized outputs will be tracked by comparing the model's outputs with those of the control model. The integration of these techniques will be facilitated by building a new module to handle the interaction between MIP and counterfactual memorization, ensuring seamless data flow and evaluation. The setup will include configuring the transformer model, preparing the dataset with masked identifiers, and implementing the comparison logic for counterfactual memorization. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be BLEU scores, which measure the quality of the generated code by comparing it to reference outputs. A higher BLEU score indicates better performance in generating syntactically and semantically correct code. The secondary metric will be the frequency of memorized outputs, quantified by comparing the model's outputs with those of a control model trained on separate data. A reduction in memorized outputs will indicate improved generalization and reduced memorization. The experiment will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical significance, and success will be interpreted as a significant improvement in BLEU scores and a reduction in memorized outputs compared to a baseline model without the integrated techniques.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment to evaluate the integration of masked identifier prediction (MIP) with counterfactual memorization techniques for code generation.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Hierarchical Attention with Positional Encoding\nShort Description: Integrating hierarchical attention and positional encoding adjustments in BERT for improved narrative understanding.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating a hierarchical attention mechanism with positional encoding adjustments in BERT will significantly improve narrative understanding performance, as measured by F1 score, compared to using standard attention mechanisms.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating a hierarchical attention mechanism with positional encoding adjustments in BERT\nDependent variable: Narrative understanding performance\nComparison groups: Hierarchical attention mechanism with positional encoding adjustments vs. standard attention mechanisms\nBaseline/control: Standard attention mechanisms\nContext/setting: Not explicitly stated\nAssumptions: Hierarchical attention mechanism and positional encoding adjustments can be integrated into BERT\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not explicitly stated\nTimeframe: Not explicitly stated\nMeasurement method: F1 score\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of a hierarchical attention mechanism (HAM) with positional encoding adjustments in the BERT model to enhance its narrative understanding capabilities. The hierarchical attention mechanism is designed to capture both high-level and low-level features within a sequence, allowing for a more nuanced representation of input sequences. By adjusting the weight distribution across different layers of attention, the model can prioritize middle-context information, which is crucial for understanding complex narratives. Positional encoding adjustments further emphasize the middle context of input sequences by modifying the standard positional encodings used in transformer models. This combination is expected to improve the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies and nuanced contextual information, leading to better performance on narrative understanding tasks. The hypothesis will be tested using the F1 score as the primary metric, comparing the performance of the modified BERT model against a baseline using standard attention mechanisms. \nKey Variables:\nHierarchical Attention Mechanism: The hierarchical attention mechanism (HAM) is implemented by stacking multiple attention layers, each focusing on different levels of the input, such as word-level, sentence-level, and document-level. This allows the model to capture both local and global dependencies, improving its ability to understand complex narratives. The HAM will be integrated into the BERT model by using separate attention heads for each level of abstraction, ensuring that the middle context is given prominence. This approach is particularly effective in tasks requiring nuanced understanding of narrative structures, as it allows for a more comprehensive representation of the input sequence.\nPositional Encoding Adjustments: Positional encoding adjustments involve modifying the standard positional encodings used in transformer models to emphasize the middle context of input sequences. This can be achieved by altering the sinusoidal functions that are typically used to encode positional information, thereby increasing the attention weights assigned to tokens located in the middle of the sequence. This approach leverages the transformer architecture's ability to handle long-range dependencies by ensuring that middle-context tokens are more prominently featured in the attention score computations. Implementing this requires changes in the model's architecture to accommodate the new encoding scheme, potentially involving additional layers or modified attention heads to ensure that the middle context is prioritized during both training and inference phases.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the BERT model as the base architecture. The hierarchical attention mechanism (HAM) will be integrated by adding multiple attention layers, each focusing on different levels of abstraction, such as word-level, sentence-level, and document-level. This will involve using separate attention heads for each level and combining their outputs to form a comprehensive representation of the input sequence. Positional encoding adjustments will be made by modifying the sinusoidal functions used in standard positional encodings to emphasize the middle context of input sequences. This will require changes in the model's architecture to accommodate the new encoding scheme, potentially involving additional layers or modified attention heads. The implementation will be carried out using existing libraries and frameworks for transformer models, such as Hugging Face's Transformers library. The modified BERT model will be trained and evaluated on narrative understanding tasks using benchmark datasets, and its performance will be compared against a baseline model using standard attention mechanisms. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the F1 score, which provides a balance between precision and recall. The F1 score will be calculated based on the model's ability to accurately identify and understand narrative elements in benchmark datasets. The performance of the modified BERT model will be compared against a baseline model using standard attention mechanisms. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher F1 score for the modified model compared to the baseline. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical significance, and results will be reported with confidence intervals. Secondary metrics may include accuracy and precision to provide additional insights into the model's performance.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment comparing a baseline BERT model against a modified BERT model with hierarchical attention and adjusted positional encoding for narrative understanding. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot phases controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable.\n\nPhase Specifications:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 narrative examples from training set, 2 epochs, batch size 2\n- PILOT: Use 100 narrative examples from training set, 50 from dev set, 5 epochs, batch size 8\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset, 10 epochs, batch size 32\n\nImplementation Steps:\n1. Use Huggingface Datasets API to load a narrative understanding dataset (e.g., ROCStories or WritingPrompts)\n\n2. Implement two model variants:\nBaseline: Standard BERT model from Huggingface\nExperimental: Modified BERT with:\n   a) Hierarchical attention: Implement three attention levels (word, sentence, document)\n   b) Modified positional encoding: Adjust sinusoidal encoding to emphasize middle-context\n\n3. Training procedure:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for any LLM components\n- Train both models on same data splits\n- Log training metrics (loss, F1) every 100 steps\n- Generate line plots comparing training curves\n\n4.

METRICEVAL provides a structured analysis of NLG metrics using measurement theory, ensuring reliability and validity. BERTScore's cosine similarity captures nuanced semantic content, while BLEURT's fine-tuning aligns scores with human judgments. The combination is expected to leverage the strengths of each component: METRICEVAL's systematic evaluation, BERTScore's semantic sensitivity, and BLEURT's human alignment. This synergy is hypothesized to improve the Pearson correlation with human judgments by addressing the limitations of LLM-based metrics, such as bias towards LLM-generated texts and lack of semantic depth. The research will involve implementing the hybrid framework and comparing its performance against LLM-based metrics using datasets adapted for cross-lingual cross-temporal summarization. The expected outcome is a more robust evaluation metric that better reflects human preferences across diverse linguistic and temporal contexts. \nKey Variables:\nMETRICEVAL: METRICEVAL is a theory-driven framework designed to systematically analyze and evaluate NLG metrics using measurement theory. It assesses the reliability and validity of evaluation metrics by measuring their correlation with human evaluations. In this research, METRICEVAL will be used to provide a structured evaluation of the hybrid framework's performance, ensuring that the metrics align with human preferences. This framework is selected for its ability to identify issues and improve the robustness of evaluation metrics, making it a suitable choice for enhancing the alignment with human judgments.\nBERTScore's Cosine Similarity: BERTScore leverages BERT contextual embeddings to compute textual similarity through cosine similarity measurements between token representations. This method captures deeper contextual relationships beyond simple lexical matching, making it effective for evaluating semantic content. In this research, BERTScore's cosine similarity will be used to assess the semantic similarity of generated summaries, providing a nuanced comparison that aligns with human judgments. This variable is chosen for its ability to capture semantic nuances, which are crucial for evaluating cross-lingual cross-temporal summarization tasks.\nBLEURT's Fine-tuning on Human-annotated Data: BLEURT is a neural-based metric fine-tuned on human-annotated datasets to predict text quality. This process aligns its scores with human judgments, improving its ability to evaluate text quality across various NLG tasks. In this research, BLEURT's fine-tuning will be used to enhance the alignment of evaluation scores with human preferences, providing a more reliable assessment of text quality. This variable is selected for its demonstrated ability to outperform traditional metrics in capturing semantic nuances and contextual relevance.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by first setting up METRICEVAL to provide a structured evaluation framework. This involves configuring METRICEVAL to analyze the reliability and validity of the evaluation metrics used in the hybrid framework. Next, BERTScore's cosine similarity will be integrated to assess the semantic similarity of generated summaries. This requires using pre-trained BERT models to generate embeddings for both generated and reference texts, followed by computing cosine similarity for each token pair. BLEURT's fine-tuning on human-annotated data will be incorporated to align evaluation scores with human judgments. This involves using a pre-trained BLEURT model fine-tuned on datasets with human annotations. The hybrid framework will be tested on datasets adapted for cross-lingual cross-temporal summarization tasks, with METRICEVAL providing a comprehensive analysis of the results. The implementation will involve setting up a pipeline where METRICEVAL, BERTScore, and BLEURT work in tandem to evaluate generated summaries, with data flowing between components to ensure a seamless evaluation process. The final output will be the Pearson correlation between the hybrid framework's scores and simulated human judgments, providing a measure of alignment with human preferences. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the Pearson correlation between the hybrid framework's scores and simulated human judgments. This metric assesses the alignment of evaluation scores with human preferences, providing a quantitative measure of evaluation quality. The control condition will be the performance of LLM-based metrics alone, serving as a baseline for comparison. Success will be interpreted as a higher Pearson correlation for the hybrid framework compared to the baseline, indicating improved alignment with human judgments. The evaluation will involve multiple runs on datasets adapted for cross-lingual cross-temporal summarization tasks, ensuring statistical confidence in the results. Secondary metrics may include Spearman correlation to assess rank-order agreement and qualitative evaluations to provide insights into the framework's performance across different linguistic and temporal contexts.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to compare a hybrid evaluation framework against LLM-based metrics for cross-lingual cross-temporal summarization evaluation.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: QBAF-Enhanced Multi-Agent Debates\nShort Description: Integrating QBAFs with multi-agent debates to improve LLM fact-checking precision.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks with Multi-Agent LLM Debates will improve the precision of LLM outputs in fact-checking tasks compared to using either method independently.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks with Multi-Agent LLM Debates\nDependent variable: Precision of LLM outputs in fact-checking tasks\nComparison groups: Using Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks and Multi-Agent LLM Debates independently\nBaseline/control: Using either method independently\nContext/setting: Fact-checking tasks\nAssumptions: Integration of methods will lead to improvement\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: LLM outputs\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Precision assessment\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs) with Multi-Agent LLM Debates to enhance the precision of LLM outputs in fact-checking tasks. QBAFs provide a structured approach to evaluate arguments by assigning numerical strengths to arguments and their interactions, allowing for a nuanced assessment of argument validity. Multi-Agent LLM Debates involve multiple language model agents engaging in structured discussions to refine outputs and identify errors. By combining these two approaches, the research aims to leverage the systematic evaluation of QBAFs with the collaborative refinement process of multi-agent debates. This integration is expected to improve the precision of fact-checking outputs by ensuring that only arguments with strong support are considered valid, while also allowing for dynamic error correction through debate. The expected outcome is a more accurate and reliable fact-checking process, addressing gaps in current methodologies that often rely on single-agent prompting or lack a quantitative evaluation of argument strength. \nKey Variables:\nQuantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs): QBAFs extend traditional argumentation frameworks by incorporating quantitative measures of argument strength and bipolar interactions, including both attack and support relations. In this research, QBAFs will be used to assign numerical values to arguments, representing their intrinsic strength and the overall strength of their interactions. This framework allows for deterministic inference under gradual semantics, enabling a nuanced evaluation of arguments. The choice of QBAFs over other frameworks is due to their ability to handle varying degrees of argument influence, which is crucial for fact-checking tasks where arguments may have different levels of validity. The expected role of QBAFs is to provide a structured mechanism for evaluating the strength of arguments, ensuring that only well-supported arguments are considered in the final output.\nMulti-Agent LLM Debates: Multi-Agent LLM Debates involve multiple language model agents engaging in structured debates to refine outputs and improve factual accuracy. Each agent presents arguments and counterarguments, and the process is designed to facilitate collaboration and identify errors in reasoning. This approach has been shown to enhance reasoning performance by fostering divergent thinking and achieving higher levels of agreement among agents. In this research, multi-agent debates will be used to dynamically refine the outputs generated by the LLMs, allowing for real-time error correction and consensus building. The choice of multi-agent debates is based on their ability to improve reasoning reliability and performance, which is essential for fact-checking tasks that require high precision.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for LLM deployment and debate facilitation. The QBAFs will be integrated as a separate module that assigns numerical strengths to arguments generated by the LLMs. This module will use a graph-based model to represent arguments and their interactions, calculating the overall strength of each argument based on its intrinsic value and the influence of supporting and opposing arguments. The multi-agent debate framework will involve multiple LLM agents, each tasked with evaluating different aspects of the fact-checking task. These agents will engage in structured debates, presenting arguments and counterarguments, and refining their outputs based on the consensus reached. The integration of QBAFs with the debate framework will be achieved through a glue module that combines the numerical evaluations from QBAFs with the dynamic interactions of the debates. This module will ensure that only arguments with strong support are considered valid, while allowing for real-time error correction through debate. The entire process will be automated using the Experiment Builder, which will create, run, and debug the experiment code in a container. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision, which measures the proportion of true positive results in relation to the total number of positive results predicted by the model. Precision is critical for fact-checking tasks where false positives must be minimized. The secondary metric will be the F1-score, which provides a harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a comprehensive view of the model's accuracy. The hypothesis will be tested using a benchmark fact-checking dataset, with a control condition involving LLMs without the QBAF and debate integration. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in precision and F1-score compared to the control condition, with multiple runs to ensure reliability.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate the integration of Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs) with multi-agent debates for fact-checking.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Exemplar-Schema Precision Boost\nShort Description: Combining task-specific exemplars and unified schema to enhance precision on unseen tasks.\nHypothesis to explore: Instruction tuning using task-specific exemplars combined with a unified schema for instructions will enhance the precision of language models on unseen tasks compared to models using only task definitions.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Instruction tuning using task-specific exemplars combined with a unified schema for instructions\nDependent variable: Precision of language models on unseen tasks\nComparison groups: Models using instruction tuning with task-specific exemplars and a unified schema vs. models using only task definitions\nBaseline/control: Models using only task definitions\nContext/setting: Unseen tasks\nAssumptions: Task-specific exemplars and a unified schema for instructions are effectively implemented\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Language models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Precision measurement on unseen tasks\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to investigate the impact of combining task-specific exemplars with a unified schema for instructions on the precision of language models when dealing with unseen tasks. Task-specific exemplars provide concrete examples of desired task outputs, which can help models better understand task requirements. The unified schema for instructions ensures that these exemplars are presented in a consistent format, enhancing clarity and coherence. By integrating these two approaches, the study hypothesizes that language models will achieve higher precision on unseen tasks compared to models that rely solely on task definitions. This approach addresses the gap in current research, which often focuses on either exemplars or schema individually, without exploring their combined effect. The expected outcome is an improvement in the model's ability to accurately identify relevant instances in unseen tasks, thereby enhancing overall task performance. \nKey Variables:\nTask-Specific Exemplars: Task-specific exemplars involve using positive examples of a task to guide instruction tuning. These exemplars provide concrete instances of desired outputs, helping models learn to generalize across tasks. In this experiment, task-specific exemplars will be used to fine-tune language models, providing them with clear examples of correct task execution. This approach is expected to improve the model's precision by allowing it to focus on relevant task features and outputs.\nUnified Schema for Instructions: The unified schema for instructions involves mapping diverse task instructions into a consistent format that breaks down tasks into minimal, stand-alone steps. This structure improves clarity and coherence by ensuring each task is presented logically. In this experiment, the unified schema will be used to present task-specific exemplars, ensuring that the instructions are clear and consistent. This is expected to enhance the model's ability to process and execute instructions accurately, leading to improved precision on unseen tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging its Experiment Builder to create and run the necessary experiments. The implementation will involve two main components: task-specific exemplars and a unified schema for instructions. Existing codeblocks for instruction tuning and schema mapping will be utilized. Task-specific exemplars will be sourced from existing datasets, ensuring they provide clear examples of desired task outputs. These exemplars will be formatted using a unified schema, which will be implemented using a custom codeblock to ensure consistency across all instructions. The language model will be fine-tuned using these exemplars and schema, with precision on unseen tasks being the primary evaluation metric. The Experiment Builder will automate the process, running multiple iterations to ensure robust results. Data will flow from the exemplar dataset through the schema mapping process, into the language model for fine-tuning, and finally to the evaluation phase where precision is measured. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision, measured as the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model. Precision will be calculated by comparing the model's outputs on unseen tasks to the actual outputs, focusing on the accuracy of positive predictions. The control condition will involve a baseline model using only task definitions without exemplars or schema. Success will be interpreted as a statistically significant improvement in precision for the model using exemplars and schema compared to the baseline. Multiple runs will be conducted to ensure statistical confidence, with results analyzed to confirm the hypothesis.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing two approaches to instruction-following in TextWorldExpress's CookingWorld environment:\n\n1.

Attention entropy measures the distribution of attention across tokens, providing insights into how focused or diffuse the model's attention is. Semantic induction heads encode structured relationships, enhancing the model's ability to generalize from context. By combining these two elements, the study aims to determine their collective effect on the model's ability to perform zero-shot learning, where no task-specific training data is available. The use of abstract labels forces the model to rely on input structure and distribution rather than specific label associations, providing a unique context to evaluate the effectiveness of attention entropy and semantic induction heads. This approach addresses gaps in existing literature by exploring a novel combination of variables and conditions that have not been extensively tested, offering potential improvements in model performance and understanding of in-context learning mechanisms. \nKey Variables:\nAttention Entropy: Attention entropy quantifies the spread of attention across tokens, with high entropy indicating even distribution and low entropy indicating focused attention. In this study, attention entropy is used to assess how the distribution of attention affects the model's ability to perform zero-shot learning with abstract labels. The hypothesis posits that optimal attention entropy can enhance the model's focus on relevant input structures, improving performance. This variable is measured by calculating entropy values from attention weight matrices across different layers, providing a detailed view of attention distribution.\nSemantic Induction Heads: Semantic induction heads are specialized attention heads that capture structured relationships, such as syntactic dependencies and knowledge graph associations. In this research, they are used to enhance the model's ability to generalize from context during zero-shot learning with abstract labels. By leveraging these heads, the model can better detect and replicate patterns in token sequences, improving its capacity to infer tasks from input structures. The effectiveness of semantic induction heads is evaluated by analyzing their influence on attention distributions and model predictions.\nZero-shot Learning Performance: Zero-shot learning performance is evaluated by the model's ability to perform tasks without task-specific training data, relying solely on pre-existing knowledge. In this study, zero-shot performance is measured by comparing the model's predictions against a benchmark dataset, focusing on its ability to generalize from input structures and abstract labels. The hypothesis suggests that the combination of attention entropy and semantic induction heads will enhance zero-shot learning performance, providing insights into the model's adaptability and robustness.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to analyze attention entropy and semantic induction heads in large language models. The experiment will involve configuring a pre-trained model with attention entropy metrics and semantic induction heads. Attention weight matrices will be extracted to calculate entropy values, providing insights into the distribution of attention across tokens. Semantic induction heads will be configured to capture structured relationships, enhancing the model's ability to generalize from context. The model will be tested on a benchmark dataset using abstract labels, evaluating its zero-shot learning performance. Existing codeblocks for attention weight extraction and entropy calculation will be utilized, while new modules for configuring semantic induction heads will be built. The experiment will involve running multiple iterations to ensure reliability, with data flow managed through a series of integration layers that connect attention metrics with semantic induction configurations. The setup will include defining inputs, configuring model parameters, and specifying outputs, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the hypothesis. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is zero-shot learning performance, measured by the model's accuracy in predicting labels on a benchmark dataset with abstract labels. Secondary metrics include attention entropy values and the effectiveness of semantic induction heads in influencing attention distributions. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the model's performance with and without the integration of attention entropy and semantic induction heads. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher accuracy in zero-shot learning tasks, with statistical confidence assessed through multiple runs and comparison against baseline models without these components. Qualitative evaluations will involve analyzing attention distributions and their alignment with input structures, providing insights into the model's interpretability and adaptability.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether structured prompting techniques that simulate attention entropy and semantic induction can improve zero-shot learning performance. The experiment should use gpt-4o-mini as the base model.\n\nExperimental Design:\n1.

Evaluation:\n- Primary metric: Classification accuracy\n- Secondary metrics: Response consistency, confidence scores\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare conditions\n- Generate plots showing:\n  * Performance across conditions\n  * Learning curves (if applicable)\n  * Confidence distributions\n\n6. Output Requirements:\n- Detailed logs of all prompts and responses\n- Statistical comparisons between conditions\n- Visualization of results\n- Summary report with key findings\n\nPlease implement this experiment starting with MINI_PILOT mode. After successful completion and verification, proceed to PILOT mode. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT mode for human verification of results.\n\nNote: All prompts should be logged for verification. Use bootstrap resampling to determine if differences between conditions are statistically significant. Generate plots to visualize the results clearly. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

The hypothesis posits that this combination will improve both the convergence rate and accuracy of the models. The choice of 5000 iterations is based on its effectiveness in achieving stable model performance in similar engineering tasks, while LoRA is selected for its ability to reduce the number of trainable parameters by decomposing weight matrices into low-rank matrices. This approach is expected to maintain model performance while minimizing communication costs, which is crucial in federated learning settings. By focusing on these specific variable combinations, the research seeks to address gaps in existing literature where the interplay between iteration count and parameter reduction techniques like LoRA has not been extensively explored. The expected outcome is that this combination will lead to faster convergence and higher accuracy, providing a more efficient and effective approach to training BERT models in distributed environments. \nKey Variables:\nNumber of Training Iterations: The variable represents the number of complete passes through the training dataset. In this study, it is set to 5000 iterations, a number found to stabilize model performance in engineering tasks. This choice is based on its ability to achieve a balance between accuracy improvement and computational efficiency, avoiding overfitting while ensuring thorough training.\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA): LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that reduces the number of trainable parameters by decomposing weight matrices into low-rank matrices. This technique is particularly effective in federated learning environments as it minimizes communication overhead while maintaining model performance. The use of LoRA in this study aims to enhance the adaptability of BERT models to sentiment analysis tasks by focusing on essential parameter updates, thereby improving convergence rates and accuracy.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using a combination of existing codeblocks and newly developed components. The BERT model will be set up with 5000 training iterations, leveraging the 'Federated Learning Framework' codeblock to manage the distributed training environment. LoRA will be integrated into the model using a custom 'LoRA Integration Module' to decompose weight matrices into low-rank matrices. The training process will involve iterating through the dataset 5000 times, with LoRA applied to reduce parameter updates. The 'Federated Communication Module' will handle the transmission of model updates between clients and the server, ensuring efficient communication. Data flow will involve inputting sentiment analysis datasets into the BERT model, applying LoRA for parameter reduction, and monitoring convergence rates and accuracy through the 'Performance Monitoring Module'. This setup will allow for a comprehensive evaluation of the hypothesis, focusing on the impact of iteration count and LoRA on model performance. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be convergence rate and accuracy. Convergence rate will be assessed by monitoring the decrease in loss function value over iterations, with a steeper slope indicating faster convergence. Accuracy will be measured using the F1 Score, which balances precision and recall, providing a comprehensive view of model performance in sentiment analysis tasks. The evaluation will involve comparing the performance of the BERT model with 5000 iterations and LoRA against a baseline model trained with fewer iterations or different parameter reduction techniques. Success will be indicated by a significant improvement in both convergence rate and accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing BERT models with and without LoRA for sentiment analysis, with different numbers of training iterations. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable.\n\nDataset:\n- Use the Huggingface Hub API to load the IMDB sentiment analysis dataset\n- For MINI_PILOT: Use 100 examples (80 train/20 dev)\n- For PILOT: Use 1000 examples (800 train/200 dev)\n- For FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use the full dataset with standard train/dev/test splits\n\nExperimental Conditions:\n1.

MoCo is a contrastive learning technique that utilizes a dynamic dictionary to improve semantic feature extraction, making it suitable for large-scale data scenarios. By combining MoCo with semantic-aware data prioritization, which dynamically prioritizes critical information based on semantic content, the study aims to enhance semantic spectral efficiency. The hypothesis posits that this integration will lead to significant improvements in semantic transmission rate and semantic similarity compared to traditional methods that do not employ semantic-aware prioritization. The motivation for this research stems from the need to optimize resource allocation in spectrum-constrained environments, where efficient transmission of semantic information is crucial. The expected outcome is a more efficient use of spectrum resources, resulting in higher quality of service and reduced interference in IRS-enhanced networks. \nKey Variables:\nMoCo-based Semantic Communications: MoCo (Momentum Contrast) is a contrastive learning framework that maintains a dynamic dictionary of data samples, allowing for the efficient use of negative samples to improve semantic feature extraction. In this study, MoCo is used to enhance semantic communications by creating robust semantic representations that improve transmission and understanding of semantic information. The dynamic dictionary and contrastive loss function are key components, with hyperparameters such as queue size and momentum coefficient being critical for performance. MoCo is selected for its ability to handle large-scale data, making it ideal for IRS-enhanced networks where data volume and complexity are high.\nSemantic-Aware Data Prioritization: Semantic-aware data prioritization involves dynamically prioritizing critical information based on semantic content and contextual relevance. This technique uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to interpret data meaning, assigning priority scores based on predefined keywords and data size thresholds. By focusing on transmitting the most important semantic information, this approach optimizes resource usage and improves communication efficiency. It is particularly relevant in IRS-enhanced networks, where efficient resource allocation is crucial for maintaining high-quality communication. The prioritization process is evaluated using metrics such as semantic transmission rate and semantic similarity.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for MoCo-based semantic communications and building new modules for semantic-aware data prioritization. The MoCo framework will be used to train a neural network that maximizes agreement between augmented views of data points, utilizing a dynamic dictionary for efficient contrastive learning. The semantic-aware data prioritization module will be developed to dynamically assign priority scores to data based on semantic content, using NLP and machine learning techniques. The integration of these components will involve creating a pipeline where semantic data is first processed by MoCo for feature extraction, then prioritized based on semantic relevance before transmission. The IRS-enhanced network environment will be simulated to test the hypothesis, with metrics such as semantic transmission rate and semantic similarity being used to evaluate performance. Data flows will be managed through existing APIs, with new logic built to handle the prioritization process and integrate it with the MoCo framework. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are semantic transmission rate and semantic similarity. The semantic transmission rate will be measured in semantic units per second, reflecting the efficiency of semantic content transmission. Semantic similarity will be assessed using cosine similarity, comparing the alignment of transmitted and received semantic content. The control condition will involve a baseline setup without semantic-aware prioritization, allowing for comparative analysis. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in both metrics compared to the baseline, with multiple runs conducted to ensure reliability. The evaluation will focus on the ability of the integrated system to maintain high semantic integrity and transmission efficiency in IRS-enhanced networks.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test semantic-aware prioritization in a simulated communication network.

Federated Prompt Tuning focuses on updating only the prompt vectors, significantly reducing the number of parameters to be updated. FedPerfix, on the other hand, personalizes the self-attention layer of Vision Transformers using prefix-tuning to capture client-specific knowledge. By combining these two approaches, the hypothesis posits that the model will achieve better performance and efficiency than using FedPerfix alone. The integration aims to leverage the strengths of both methods: the parameter efficiency of Federated Prompt Tuning and the personalization capabilities of FedPerfix. This combination is expected to address the challenges of data heterogeneity and multilingual adaptation, providing a more robust and efficient federated learning framework. The expected outcome is an improvement in accuracy and F1-score, along with a reduction in trainable parameters and memory usage, demonstrating the synergy of these techniques in federated learning contexts. \nKey Variables:\nFederated Prompt Tuning: Federated Prompt Tuning involves updating only the prompt vectors during the tuning process, significantly reducing the number of parameters to be updated. This method is particularly useful in multilingual scenarios as it allows for effective adaptation to different languages by leveraging decentralized data across clients. The implementation includes designing discrete prompts or continuous task-specific vectors that are concatenated with the input data and sent to the language model. This approach not only reduces communication costs but also maintains model accuracy by focusing on language-specific adaptations.\nFedPerfix Framework: FedPerfix personalizes the self-attention layer of Vision Transformers using prefix-tuning within a federated learning framework. This approach involves adding trainable prefix vectors to the self-attention layers, enabling the model to capture client-specific knowledge without altering the pre-trained model's weights. It is particularly effective in scenarios with heterogeneous data distributions, allowing for partial model personalization tailored to individual client data. Evaluations on datasets like CIFAR-100 and OrganAMINIST have shown that FedPerfix achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower resource requirements compared to other methods.\n\nImplementation: To implement the hypothesis, the experiment will integrate Federated Prompt Tuning with the FedPerfix framework. The Federated Prompt Tuning will be implemented by designing discrete prompts or continuous task-specific vectors that are concatenated with the input data and sent to the language model. These prompts will be fine-tuned on decentralized data across multiple devices, ensuring efficient adaptation to different languages. The FedPerfix framework will be used to personalize the self-attention layer of Vision Transformers. This involves adding trainable prefix vectors to the self-attention layers, enabling the model to capture client-specific knowledge. The integration will be tested on multilingual datasets, such as CIFAR-100 and OrganAMINIST, to evaluate the model's performance and parameter efficiency. The experiment will measure accuracy and F1-score as primary metrics, while trainable parameter count and memory usage will be assessed for parameter efficiency. The implementation will involve using existing codeblocks for Federated Prompt Tuning and FedPerfix, with necessary adaptations to integrate the two methods. The data flow will involve feeding input data through the prompt-tuned model, followed by personalization using FedPerfix, and finally evaluating the output against the benchmark datasets. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be accuracy and F1-score, which will measure the model's performance in multilingual and heterogeneous client scenarios. The secondary metrics will include trainable parameter count and memory usage, assessing the parameter efficiency of the integrated approach. The hypothesis will be tested using benchmark datasets like CIFAR-100 and OrganAMINIST, with a control condition using FedPerfix alone. Improvement will be interpreted as higher accuracy and F1-score, along with reduced trainable parameters and memory usage compared to the baseline. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with qualitative assessments derived from the model's performance on diverse datasets.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing FedPerfix (baseline) against FedPerfix+Prompt Tuning (experimental) in a multilingual federated learning setting. The experiment should follow these specifications:\n\nGLOBAL PARAMETERS:\n- Set PILOT_MODE to one of: 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'\n- Use gpt-4o-mini as the base language model\n- Use CIFAR-100 as the primary dataset (accessed via Huggingface)\n\nPILOT CONFIGURATIONS:\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Use 2 clients\n- Use 10 training examples per client\n- Run for 5 federated rounds\n- Use validation set of 20 examples\n\nPILOT:\n- Use 5 clients\n- Use 100 training examples per client\n- Run for 20 federated rounds\n- Use validation set of 200 examples\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n- Use 20 clients\n- Use full training set, divided among clients\n- Run for 100 federated rounds\n- Use full validation/test sets\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STEPS:\n1.

DFGs provide a structural representation of code, capturing variable interactions and dependencies, which is crucial for understanding complex code logic. CMD, on the other hand, helps identify whether the model's outputs are due to memorization or genuine understanding by comparing them with a control model trained on a different dataset. By combining these techniques, the research aims to improve CodeT5's ability to generate functionally correct and semantically meaningful code while reducing the risk of memorization. This approach addresses the limitations of existing models that often rely on memorized patterns, leading to poor generalization. The expected outcome is a model that not only performs better in code generation tasks but also provides insights into its learning behavior, distinguishing between memorization and generalization. \nKey Variables:\nData Flow Graphs: Data Flow Graphs represent the flow of data within a program, capturing dependencies between variables and operations. In this research, DFGs will be constructed from the source code and used as input features for the CodeT5 model. This approach helps the model understand the relationships between different parts of the code, improving its ability to generate functionally correct and semantically meaningful outputs. DFGs are particularly useful for tasks that require a deep understanding of code semantics, such as optimization or refactoring. The implementation involves integrating these graphs into the model's architecture, allowing it to process and learn from the graph structures during training.\nCounterfactual Memorization Detection: Counterfactual Memorization Detection involves using a control model trained on a separate dataset to identify memorized content. By comparing the outputs of the main model and the control model, researchers can determine if a particular output is due to memorization or genuine model capability. This method requires the development of a control model that performs similarly to the main model but is trained on different data. The comparison is typically done by analyzing the similarity of outputs, and only those outputs that are unique to the main model are considered memorized. This technique is effective in distinguishing between memorization and generalization, especially in cases where the target is contained in the context prompt.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities, leveraging existing codeblocks and building new components where necessary. The implementation involves integrating Data Flow Graphs (DFGs) into the CodeT5 model. This requires constructing DFGs from the source code and using them as input features for the model. The DFGs will be integrated into the model's architecture, allowing it to process and learn from the graph structures during training. Additionally, a Counterfactual Memorization Detection (CMD) mechanism will be developed. This involves setting up a control model trained on a different dataset and comparing its outputs with those of the main model. The CMD mechanism will analyze the similarity of outputs to identify memorized content. The integration of DFGs and CMD will be realized through a combination of existing codeblocks and newly built modules. The data flow between components will be managed using glue modules that facilitate the integration of DFGs and CMD into the CodeT5 model. The setup will include configuring the model to accept DFGs as input, implementing the CMD mechanism, and ensuring seamless interaction between components. The expected outcome is a model that performs better in code generation tasks while effectively distinguishing between memorization and generalization. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the functional correctness of the generated code, measured using the pass@k metric. This involves running the model on a set of predefined coding tasks and checking the correctness of the generated solutions against a set of test cases. The secondary metric will be the reduction in memorization, assessed using the CMD mechanism. This involves comparing the outputs of the main model and the control model to identify memorized content.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Hybrid Deduplication Impact\nShort Description: Investigate the impact of combining MinHash and semantic deduplication on language model novelty and memorization.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating MinHash deduplication with semantic deduplication in language model training datasets will lead to reduced sequence repetition and increased novelty of generated text, compared to using either method alone.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integration of MinHash deduplication with semantic deduplication\nDependent variable: Reduced sequence repetition and increased novelty of generated text\nComparison groups: Integration of both methods vs. each method alone\nBaseline/control: Using either MinHash or semantic deduplication alone\nContext/setting: Language model training datasets\nAssumptions: Integration of methods is feasible and effective\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Language models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Not specified\n\nLong Description: Description: This research investigates the combined effect of MinHash deduplication and semantic deduplication on language model performance, specifically targeting the novelty and sequence repetition rate of generated text. MinHash deduplication efficiently identifies near-duplicate documents by creating compact hash signatures, which are compared to detect similarities. This method is particularly effective for large datasets where exact matching is computationally prohibitive. Semantic deduplication, on the other hand, uses embeddings from pretrained models to capture the semantic content of documents, identifying duplicates that share meanings but differ in wording. By integrating these two methods, we aim to leverage the strengths of both approaches: MinHash's efficiency in handling large-scale data and semantic deduplication's ability to ensure semantic diversity. This combination is expected to reduce memorization and enhance the originality of model outputs, addressing limitations in previous studies that focused on either method in isolation. The hypothesis will be tested using a language model trained on a dataset processed with both deduplication techniques, and performance will be evaluated based on novelty (using the RAVEN metric) and sequence repetition rate. \nKey Variables:\nMinHash Deduplication: MinHash deduplication identifies near-duplicate documents by generating hash signatures for each document, which are then compared to detect similarities. This method is efficient for large datasets and helps maintain data diversity by removing redundant content. It is implemented using a fixed-length hash value and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to group similar documents. The expected role of MinHash deduplication is to reduce the dataset size by filtering out redundant documents, thereby enhancing the quality and diversity of the training data.\nSemantic Deduplication: Semantic deduplication uses embeddings from pretrained models to capture the semantic content of documents, identifying duplicates based on semantic similarity rather than exact matches. This method ensures that the training data is diverse and representative, reducing the likelihood of memorization and promoting novelty in generated outputs. It is implemented by generating embeddings for each document and comparing them using a similarity metric, such as cosine similarity. The expected role of semantic deduplication is to enhance the quality of training data by ensuring exposure to a diverse range of semantically distinct examples.\nNovelty (RAVEN Metric): Novelty, measured by the RAVEN metric, evaluates the originality and diversity of text generated by a language model. It assesses novelty by comparing generated outputs against existing datasets to determine the proportion of unique content. The RAVEN metric is implemented by calculating the overlap of n-grams between the generated text and a reference corpus, with lower overlap indicating higher novelty. The expected role of this metric is to quantify the uniqueness of model outputs, providing a measure of the model's ability to generate novel content.\nSequence Repetition Rate: Sequence repetition rate measures the extent of memorization in language models by tracking how often sequences from the training data are reproduced in the generated text. It is calculated by identifying the fraction of sequences in the model's output that are repeated from the training data. The expected role of this metric is to ensure that the model generates novel content and to assess the effectiveness of deduplication techniques in reducing memorization.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate MinHash and semantic deduplication into the language model training pipeline. The MinHash deduplication will be implemented using a 128-bit hash value and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to group similar documents. This will involve generating MinHash signatures for each document and comparing them to identify duplicates. Semantic deduplication will be implemented by generating embeddings for each document using a pretrained model, such as BERT, and comparing these embeddings using cosine similarity to identify semantically similar entries. The deduplicated dataset will then be used to train a language model, and the performance will be evaluated based on novelty and sequence repetition rate. The RAVEN metric will be used to assess novelty by comparing the generated text against a reference corpus, while the sequence repetition rate will be calculated by identifying repeated sequences in the model's output. The implementation will involve existing codeblocks for MinHash deduplication and embedding generation, with additional logic built to integrate these components and evaluate the hypothesis. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are novelty, measured by the RAVEN metric, and sequence repetition rate. Novelty will be assessed by calculating the overlap of n-grams between the generated text and a reference corpus, with lower overlap indicating higher novelty. Sequence repetition rate will be calculated by identifying the fraction of sequences in the model's output that are repeated from the training data. The hypothesis will be tested using a language model trained on a dataset processed with both MinHash and semantic deduplication techniques. The control condition will be a model trained on a dataset processed with only one deduplication method. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant reduction in sequence repetition rate and an increase in novelty compared to the control condition.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether combining MinHash and semantic deduplication improves language model performance compared to using either method alone. The experiment should be implemented as a pilot study with three possible settings (controlled by PILOT_MODE global variable):\n\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Use 100 documents from the wikitext-103-raw-v1 dataset (Huggingface)\n- Process these documents using 3 conditions: MinHash only, Semantic only, and Combined\n- Generate 10 samples of text (100 tokens each) using gpt-4o-mini for each condition\n- Evaluate using RAVEN metric and sequence repetition rate\n\nPILOT:\n- Use 1000 documents from wikitext-103-raw-v1\n- Process using all 3 conditions\n- Generate 50 samples (100 tokens each) using gpt-4o-mini per condition\n- Evaluate using both metrics\n\nFULL EXPERIMENT:\n- Use full wikitext-103-raw-v1 dataset\n- Process using all 3 conditions\n- Generate 500 samples per condition\n- Full evaluation\n\nSpecific Implementation Details:\n1.

Evaluation Metrics:\n   - RAVEN metric: Calculate n-gram overlap (n=1,2,3,4) between generated text and reference corpus\n   - Sequence repetition: Calculate fraction of 4-grams in output that appear in training data\n\n3. Statistical Analysis:\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to compare performance between conditions\n   - Report mean, std dev, and p-values for both metrics\n   - Generate plots of results\n\n4. Implementation Flow:\n   a. Load dataset using Huggingface API\n   b. Apply deduplication methods\n   c. For each condition:\n      - Prompt gpt-4o-mini to generate text\n      - Calculate metrics\n   d. Perform statistical analysis\n   e. Generate report\n\nThe experiment should first run MINI_PILOT. If successful, proceed to PILOT, then stop (do not run FULL EXPERIMENT without human verification).\n\nLogging Requirements:\n- Log all major steps and intermediate results\n- Save processed datasets for each condition\n- Save all generated texts\n- Save detailed metric calculations\n- Generate summary report with statistical analysis\n\nError Handling:\n- Implement robust error handling for API calls\n- Save partial results if errors occur\n- Log all errors with stack traces\n\nPrompt Template for Text Generation:\n'Given the following context from a dataset, please generate a continuation of approximately 100 tokens that is both coherent and novel: {context}' \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

The study focuses on recognizing emotions such as joy, surprise, and disgust in video content. The EMG data will be collected using electrodes placed according to the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and processed using a biomedical signal amplifier. The KNN classifier will utilize the average power in the time domain as input features to classify emotions. Decision-level fusion will involve processing audio and visual signals separately and combining their outputs with the EMG classification results to make a final emotion recognition decision. This approach leverages the strengths of each modality, providing a more comprehensive analysis of emotional expressions. The hypothesis will be tested using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics on the CREMA-D dataset. This research addresses the gap in existing studies by exploring a novel combination of EMG data integration with decision-level fusion, which has not been extensively tested in similar papers. \nKey Variables:\nFacial Electromyography (EMG) Data Integration: The study will use electrodes placed according to the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to capture facial muscle activity. A biomedical signal amplifier will enhance the quality of EMG signal recordings, and the average power in the time domain will be calculated as a key feature for emotion recognition. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier will be employed to categorize emotions based on EMG signal features. This setup ensures precise tracking of muscle movements associated with specific emotions, providing a reliable source of muscle activity data that can be synchronized with audio-visual signals.\nAudio-Visual Signal Usage: Decision-level fusion will be used to process audio and visual signals separately through independent models and then combine their outputs to make a final emotion recognition decision. Each modality will be analyzed using specialized models to extract modality-specific features, and the outputs will be fused using techniques like weighted averaging or voting schemes. This approach allows for flexibility in handling different types of data and can improve robustness by leveraging the strengths of each modality.\nEmotions Recognized: The study will focus on recognizing emotions such as joy, surprise, and disgust. These emotions will be detected through facial EMG signals using electrodes aligned with FACS, and the EMG data will be processed to extract average power features in the time domain. The KNN classifier will use these features to classify emotions, and the decision-level fusion will integrate the EMG classification results with audio-visual outputs to enhance emotion recognition accuracy.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, which will automate the experiment design, execution, and analysis. The experiment will start with the collection of facial EMG data using electrodes placed according to FACS and a biomedical signal amplifier to enhance signal quality. The EMG signals will be segmented, and the average power in the time domain will be calculated as a feature. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier will be used to categorize emotions based on these features. Simultaneously, audio and visual signals will be processed separately using existing models to extract modality-specific features. Decision-level fusion will then combine the outputs of the audio, visual, and EMG modalities using weighted averaging or voting schemes to make a final emotion recognition decision. The CREMA-D dataset will be used to benchmark the performance of the system, and precision, recall, and F1-score metrics will be calculated to evaluate the hypothesis. The implementation will involve existing codeblocks for EMG data processing, KNN classification, and decision-level fusion, with minor adaptations to integrate these components effectively. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision, recall, and F1-score. Precision will measure the ratio of correctly identified positive observations to the total predicted positives, recall will measure the ability to correctly identify all relevant instances of a particular emotion, and the F1-score will provide a balance between precision and recall. The CREMA-D dataset will serve as the benchmark for testing the hypothesis, and the performance of the integrated system will be compared to a baseline using audio-visual signals alone. Improvement will be interpreted as higher precision, recall, and F1-score values for the integrated system compared to the baseline. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether integrating EMG data with audio-visual signals improves emotion recognition accuracy. Due to the impracticality of collecting real EMG data, we will simulate/mock this data.\n\nDataset:\n1. Use the Huggingface Datasets API to load the CREMA-D dataset.\n2.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Optimized Federated Prompt Integration\nShort Description: Integrating Shared Global and Local Prompts with FedOTP to enhance federated learning efficiency.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating Shared Global and Local Prompts with the FedOTP framework will reduce communication costs by focusing on prompt embeddings and mitigate parameter interference through optimal transport alignment, leading to improved task-specific performance in federated learning scenarios.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating Shared Global and Local Prompts with the FedOTP framework\nDependent variable: Communication costs, parameter interference, task-specific performance\nComparison groups: Not explicitly mentioned\nBaseline/control: Not explicitly mentioned\nContext/setting: Federated learning scenarios\nAssumptions: Optimal transport alignment is effective; focusing on prompt embeddings reduces costs\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not explicitly mentioned\nTimeframe: Not explicitly mentioned\nMeasurement method: Not explicitly mentioned\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of Shared Global and Local Prompts with the FedOTP framework to enhance federated learning efficiency and performance. Shared Global and Local Prompts involve learning a shared global prompt to extract consensus information across clients while maintaining local prompts for client-specific knowledge. This method is combined with the FedOTP framework, which applies optimal transport-based alignment to regularize both global and local prompts. The integration aims to reduce communication costs by focusing on transmitting prompt embeddings rather than full model weights, which is crucial in bandwidth-limited environments. Additionally, the optimal transport alignment is expected to mitigate parameter interference by ensuring that the prompts capture both global consensus and local personalization. This combination addresses the challenges of non-IID data distributions and parameter interference, which are common in federated learning. The expected outcome is improved task-specific performance, measured through metrics such as accuracy and F1 Score, by enhancing model adaptability and convergence in diverse data settings. \nKey Variables:\nShared Global and Local Prompts: This variable represents a strategy where a shared global prompt is learned to extract consensus information across all clients, while local prompts capture client-specific knowledge. The global prompt provides a common context that aligns with overall task objectives, while local prompts are tailored to individual client data distributions. This approach is implemented using FedAvg for server aggregation of prompt embeddings and optimal transport-based alignment to balance global consensus with local personalization. This variable is expected to reduce communication costs by focusing on prompt embeddings and mitigate parameter interference by ensuring alignment between global and local prompts.\nFedOTP Framework: FedOTP is a federated learning framework that introduces a strategy where a shared global prompt is learned alongside local prompts for each client. This framework mitigates feature and label shifts by applying optimal transport-based alignment to regularize both global and local prompts. The implementation involves training a global prompt on the server that captures commonalities across clients, while each client simultaneously trains a local prompt to adapt to its specific data distribution. This dual-prompt strategy ensures a balance between global consensus and local personalization, enhancing the model's adaptability to heterogeneous data. The expected role of this variable is to improve model convergence and stability by addressing parameter interference and communication costs.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for federated learning and prompt tuning. The Shared Global and Local Prompts will be integrated with the FedOTP framework, which requires building a new component for optimal transport-based alignment. The implementation involves setting up a federated learning environment with multiple clients, each training local prompts based on their data distribution. These local prompts are then aggregated at the server using FedAvg to form a global prompt set. The optimal transport-based alignment is applied to ensure that the global and local prompts are regularized, capturing both consensus information and client-specific knowledge. The system will focus on transmitting prompt embeddings to reduce communication costs. The experiment will be conducted on a simulated federated learning environment with non-IID data distributions, and the performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and F1 Score. The implementation will involve setting up the federated learning framework, configuring the prompt tuning strategy, and integrating the optimal transport-based alignment mechanism. The data flow involves clients updating their local prompts, sending these updates to the server, where they are aggregated and redistributed for further training. The hypothesis will be realized by measuring the impact on communication costs and parameter interference, comparing the integrated approach against baseline federated learning methods. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are communication costs and parameter interference. Communication costs will be measured by the volume of data transferred during model updates, focusing on the reduction achieved by transmitting prompt embeddings instead of full model weights. Parameter interference will be assessed through model convergence metrics, evaluating the stability and accuracy of the model across diverse client data distributions. Secondary metrics include task-specific performance indicators such as accuracy and F1 Score, which will provide insights into the model's ability to adapt to heterogeneous data. The evaluation will involve comparing the integrated approach against baseline federated learning methods, using statistical analysis to determine the significance of any observed improvements. Success will be interpreted as a significant reduction in communication costs and parameter interference, alongside improved task-specific performance.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing baseline federated learning against our proposed Optimized Federated Prompt Integration approach. The experiment should include the following components:\n\n1. EXPERIMENT MODES:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 2 clients, 10 training examples per client, 5 test examples.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Statistically significant reduction in communication costs\n- No degradation (or improvement) in task performance\n- Reduced parameter interference in experimental condition\n\nPlease implement the above experiment, starting with MINI_PILOT mode. Report all results and wait for human verification before proceeding to PILOT mode. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

CoT prompting involves guiding the language model through intermediate reasoning steps, which enhances its ability to handle complex tasks by breaking them down into simpler subtasks. On the other hand, Dynamic Selection of Scene Elaboration Components involves using a model to select the most relevant scene elaboration components based on the task context, providing detailed contextual information that aids in generating more accurate summaries. By combining these two techniques, the research aims to leverage the structured reasoning capabilities of CoT prompting with the contextual richness provided by dynamic scene elaborations. This combination is expected to improve the coherence and informativeness of generated summaries, as measured by ROUGE scores. The study addresses gaps in existing literature by exploring this novel combination, which has not been extensively tested in similar papers. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in text summarization performance, demonstrating the synergistic potential of combining structured reasoning with adaptive contextual elaboration. \nKey Variables:\nChain-of-Thought Prompting: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting involves decomposing complex tasks into simpler subtasks, allowing the language model to systematically address each part before synthesizing the final output. For text summarization, CoT prompting helps the model break down the input text into logical steps, enhancing its ability to generate coherent and concise summaries. This technique is implemented by designing prompts that guide the model through the summarization process step by step. CoT prompting is selected for its ability to improve the model's reasoning capabilities, particularly in handling intricate sentence structures and idiomatic expressions. The effectiveness of CoT prompting is measured using ROUGE scores, which evaluate the quality of generated summaries by comparing them to reference texts.\nDynamic Selection of Scene Elaboration Components: Dynamic Selection of Scene Elaboration Components involves training a model to select the most salient scene elaboration components for a given task context. This approach provides detailed contextual information that aids in improving the accuracy and coherence of generated summaries. The model dynamically chooses from a variety of scene elaboration components, tailoring the elaborations to the specific context of the task. This technique is chosen for its potential to provide more targeted and useful contextual information, enhancing the model's performance in text summarization tasks. The effectiveness of this approach is also measured using ROUGE scores, which assess the overlap between generated and reference summaries.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate Chain-of-Thought Prompting with Dynamic Selection of Scene Elaboration Components. The implementation will involve the following steps: 1. Utilize existing codeblocks for Chain-of-Thought Prompting to design prompts that guide the language model through the summarization process in logical steps. This will involve creating prompts that decompose the input text into simpler components, allowing the model to generate coherent summaries. 2. Develop a new module for Dynamic Selection of Scene Elaboration Components. This module will use a pre-trained model to dynamically select the most relevant scene elaboration components based on the task context. The module will interface with the CoT prompting component to provide additional contextual information during the summarization process. 3. Integrate the CoT prompting and dynamic scene elaboration components into a unified framework. This will involve creating a glue module that manages data flow between the components, ensuring that the selected scene elaborations are incorporated into the CoT prompting process. 4. Set up the experiment using a benchmark text summarization dataset, such as CNN/Daily Mail or XSum. The dataset will be used to evaluate the performance of the integrated system, with ROUGE scores as the primary metric. 5. Conduct multiple runs of the experiment to ensure statistical significance, comparing the performance of the integrated system against a baseline using CoT prompting alone. The results will be analyzed to determine the impact of the dynamic scene elaboration component on summarization performance. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be ROUGE scores, specifically ROUGE-N and ROUGE-L, which measure the overlap of n-grams and the longest common subsequence between generated and reference summaries, respectively. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of summarization quality by capturing both precision and recall. The hypothesis will be tested using a benchmark text summarization dataset, such as CNN/Daily Mail or XSum. The control condition will be a baseline system using Chain-of-Thought Prompting alone, without the dynamic scene elaboration component. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in ROUGE scores for the integrated system compared to the baseline. The experiment will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with results analyzed to determine the impact of the dynamic scene elaboration component on summarization performance.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether adding Dynamic Scene Elaboration to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves text summarization performance. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), with the following specifications:\n\nPILOT MODES:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 articles from the CNN/Daily Mail training set\n- PILOT: Use 100 articles from training set for initial testing, and 50 articles from validation set for evaluation\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset (but do not implement this mode yet)\n\nDATASET:\n1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: LoRA-Prompt Integration\nShort Description: Combining trainable low-rank matrices with prompt-based few-shot fine-tuning to enhance text classification.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating trainable low-rank matrices with prompt-based few-shot fine-tuning will improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of small pre-trained language models in text classification tasks compared to using either method alone.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integration of trainable low-rank matrices with prompt-based few-shot fine-tuning\nDependent variable: Accuracy and computational efficiency of small pre-trained language models\nComparison groups: Integration of both methods vs. each method alone\nBaseline/control: Using either trainable low-rank matrices or prompt-based few-shot fine-tuning alone\nContext/setting: Text classification tasks\nAssumptions: The integration of methods will lead to improvements\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Small pre-trained language models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Not specified\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the combination of trainable low-rank matrices (LoRA) and prompt-based few-shot fine-tuning to enhance the performance of small pre-trained language models in text classification tasks. Trainable low-rank matrices are integrated into the transformer architecture, allowing for parameter-efficient fine-tuning by updating only a small subset of parameters. This reduces computational costs significantly. Prompt-based few-shot fine-tuning uses natural language prompts to guide the model's learning process, turning tasks into language completion problems. This method is particularly effective in low-resource settings, where obtaining large labeled datasets is challenging. By combining these two techniques, we hypothesize that the model will achieve higher accuracy and computational efficiency than when using either method alone. This combination leverages the strengths of both approaches: the parameter efficiency of LoRA and the data efficiency of prompt-based few-shot learning. The expected outcome is a more robust and efficient model that performs well in text classification tasks with limited computational resources and data. \nKey Variables:\nTrainable Low-Rank Matrices: Trainable low-rank matrices (LoRA) involve injecting low-rank matrices into the transformer architecture while freezing the pre-trained model weights. This approach allows for parameter-efficient fine-tuning by updating only a small subset of parameters, reducing computational costs. The matrices are integrated into specific layers of the model, and their rank can be adjusted to balance performance and efficiency. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where computational resources are limited, as it significantly reduces the number of parameters that need to be updated during fine-tuning.\nPrompt-Based Few-Shot Fine-Tuning: Prompt-based few-shot fine-tuning involves using natural language prompts to guide the model's learning process. Prompts are crafted to provide context and examples for the model, effectively turning the task into a language completion problem. This method is implemented in smaller language models to make fine-tuning computationally efficient. The evaluation on NLP tasks such as classification and regression shows that this approach can outperform standard fine-tuning procedures, achieving significant improvements in low-resource settings.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities, focusing on integrating trainable low-rank matrices with prompt-based few-shot fine-tuning. The implementation will involve the following steps: 1. Select a pre-trained language model, such as BERT or RoBERTa, as the base model. 2. Implement trainable low-rank matrices by injecting them into specific layers of the transformer architecture. This will be done by modifying the model's architecture to include these matrices and adjusting their rank to balance performance and efficiency. 3. Develop a prompt-based few-shot fine-tuning pipeline. This will involve crafting natural language prompts that align with the text classification task and integrating them into the model's input. The prompts will be dynamically generated based on the task requirements. 4. Combine the two techniques by fine-tuning the model using the integrated approach. The model will be trained on a small number of labeled examples, using the prompts to guide the learning process. 5. Evaluate the model's performance on text classification tasks using benchmark datasets such as AG News or 20 Newsgroups. Metrics such as accuracy and F1 score will be used to assess the model's performance. 6. Compare the results with baseline models that use only trainable low-rank matrices or prompt-based few-shot fine-tuning. This will help determine the effectiveness of the combined approach in improving accuracy and computational efficiency. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be accuracy and F1 score. These metrics will be used to assess the model's performance on text classification tasks, focusing on its ability to correctly classify text into predefined categories. The evaluation will involve comparing the model's performance with baseline models that use only trainable low-rank matrices or prompt-based few-shot fine-tuning. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher accuracy and F1 score compared to the baselines. The evaluation will be conducted on benchmark datasets such as AG News or 20 Newsgroups, with multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence. The computational efficiency of the model will also be assessed by measuring the reduction in computational costs and storage requirements compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing LoRA-integrated prompt-based few-shot fine-tuning against baselines for text classification. The experiment should have three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) defined as a global variable.\n\nDataset:\n- Use the AG News dataset from Huggingface Hub\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 examples per class from training set\n- PILOT: Use 100 examples per class from training set, evaluate on 50 examples per class from validation set\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full training set, tune on validation set, evaluate on test set\n\nConditions to Compare:\n1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Steerable Ethical Alignment\nShort Description: Exploring steerable pluralism in LLMs for enhanced ethical alignment and bias reduction.\nHypothesis to explore: Incorporating steerable pluralism into large language models, evaluated using LocalValueBench, will improve ethical alignment and bias reduction without significantly compromising zero-shot task performance on the GLUE benchmark.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Incorporating steerable pluralism\nDependent variable: Ethical alignment, bias reduction, zero-shot task performance\nComparison groups: Models with and without steerable pluralism\nBaseline/control: Zero-shot task performance on the GLUE benchmark\nContext/setting: Evaluation using LocalValueBench\nAssumptions: Steerable pluralism can be effectively incorporated into large language models\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Large language models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Evaluation using LocalValueBench and GLUE benchmark\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of steerable pluralism into large language models (LLMs) to enhance their ethical alignment and reduce bias, while maintaining zero-shot task performance. Steerable pluralism allows LLMs to be directed towards specific ethical attributes or perspectives, which is achieved by incorporating mechanisms that enable user-guided adjustments. The LocalValueBench will be used to evaluate the ethical alignment of the models, focusing on their ability to adhere to local values and ethical standards. The hypothesis posits that steerable pluralism will improve the ethical alignment and bias reduction of LLMs, as measured by LocalValueBench, without significantly affecting their zero-shot task performance on the GLUE benchmark. This approach addresses the challenge of aligning LLMs with diverse human values and perspectives, which is crucial for their deployment in varied socio-cultural contexts. By using steerable pluralism, the research aims to provide a flexible and adaptable framework for ethical alignment, ensuring that LLMs can cater to specific ethical requirements without losing their generalization capabilities. The expected outcome is a more ethically aligned and less biased LLM that retains its performance on standard NLP tasks. \nKey Variables:\nSteerable Pluralism: Steerable pluralism involves designing LLMs that can be directed to represent specific ethical attributes or perspectives. This is achieved by incorporating mechanisms that allow the model to be 'steered' or guided by user inputs or predefined settings. The implementation might include developing a user interface or API that allows stakeholders to specify the ethical framework or perspective they wish the model to adopt. The model's adaptability is tested using trade-off steerable benchmarks, which measure its ability to switch between different ethical objectives without compromising its overall performance or coherence.\nLocalValueBench: LocalValueBench is an extensible benchmark designed to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with local values and ethical standards. It involves a thorough question curation process, incorporating a wide array of ethical scenarios and local value considerations. The benchmark uses prompt engineering strategies to probe LLMs' alignment, including posing original questions and introducing alternative perspectives. Evaluation criteria are designed to quantify deviations from established local values, ensuring an objective assessment.\nGLUE Benchmark: The GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark is a collection of nine natural language understanding tasks designed to evaluate the performance of language models. It includes tasks such as sentiment analysis, sentence similarity, and natural language inference. Models are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores across these tasks. The benchmark provides a standardized framework for assessing the capabilities of LLMs in understanding and processing human language.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by integrating steerable pluralism into existing LLMs. This involves developing a user interface or API that allows users to specify the ethical framework or perspective they wish the model to adopt. The model's adaptability will be tested using trade-off steerable benchmarks, which measure its ability to switch between different ethical objectives. The LocalValueBench will be used to evaluate the ethical alignment of the models, focusing on their ability to adhere to local values and ethical standards. The GLUE benchmark will be used to assess the zero-shot task performance of the models, ensuring that their generalization capabilities are not compromised. The implementation will involve using existing codeblocks for LLMs and developing new components for steerable pluralism and LocalValueBench integration. The data will flow from the user interface to the LLM, which will generate outputs based on the specified ethical framework. The outputs will be evaluated using LocalValueBench and GLUE benchmark metrics. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are ethical alignment and bias reduction, as measured by LocalValueBench, and zero-shot task performance, as measured by the GLUE benchmark. Ethical alignment will be assessed based on the model's adherence to local values and ethical standards, with evaluation criteria designed to quantify deviations from established local values. Bias reduction will be measured by the model's ability to generate outputs that are less biased and more aligned with ethical standards. Zero-shot task performance will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores on the GLUE benchmark tasks. Improvement or success will be interpreted based on the model's ability to achieve higher ethical alignment and bias reduction scores without a significant decrease in GLUE benchmark performance.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to test steerable pluralism in LLMs. The experiment should have the following components:\n\n1. EXPERIMENT MODES\nImplement a global variable PILOT_MODE that can be set to 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'. For this run, start with MINI_PILOT, and if successful, proceed to PILOT, then stop.\n- MINI_PILOT: 10 questions each from LocalValueBench and GLUE benchmark\n- PILOT: 100 questions each from LocalValueBench and GLUE benchmark\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: All questions (do not run this mode)\n\n2. BASELINE AND EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS\nImplement two conditions using gpt-4o-mini:\na) Baseline: Standard prompting without steerable pluralism\nb) Experimental: Steerable pluralism prompting that includes explicit ethical framework guidance\n\n3.

DATA COLLECTION\nCreate separate log files for:\n- Raw model responses\n- Evaluation metrics\n- Error cases\n- Timing information\n\n6. ANALYSIS\nPerform the following analyses:\n- Compare ethical alignment scores between baseline and experimental conditions using bootstrap resampling\n- Compare bias metrics between conditions\n- Compare GLUE benchmark performance between conditions\n- Generate summary statistics and visualizations\n\n7. OUTPUT\nGenerate a report including:\n- Summary statistics for each condition\n- Statistical significance of differences\n- Visualizations of key metrics\n- Raw data in JSON format\n- Any error logs or unusual cases\n\nThe experiment should first run in MINI_PILOT mode. If successful (no errors, reasonable outputs), proceed to PILOT mode. Stop after PILOT mode completes - do not proceed to FULL_EXPERIMENT.\n\nPlease log all steps extensively, including:\n- Configuration details\n- Each model query and response\n- Evaluation metrics\n- Error cases\n- Timing information\n\nEnsure proper error handling and recovery throughout the experiment. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

Counterfactual Data Augmentation involves creating synthetic data by swapping gendered and racial terms to ensure balanced representation in training datasets. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback uses human evaluators to guide the model's learning process, rewarding unbiased outputs and penalizing biased ones. By combining these techniques, the research aims to leverage the strengths of both methods: CDA provides a balanced dataset that reduces inherent biases, while RLHF refines the model's outputs based on human judgment, addressing biases that automated systems might miss. The expected outcome is a significant reduction in gender and racial biases, as measured by generated-text-based metrics, which evaluate the presence of stereotypes or differential treatment in model outputs. This approach addresses gaps in prior work by providing a comprehensive strategy that combines data augmentation with human-guided learning, offering a novel solution to bias mitigation in language models. \nKey Variables:\nCounterfactual Data Augmentation: Counterfactual Data Augmentation involves generating synthetic data by swapping gendered and racial terms in sentences to create balanced datasets. This technique ensures that language models are exposed to diverse perspectives, reducing reliance on biased patterns. By augmenting the training data with these counterfactual examples, the model learns from balanced data, which is expected to reduce gender and racial biases in its predictions. This variable is operationalized by systematically altering gender and racial identifiers in the training data and measuring the model's bias reduction using generated-text-based metrics.\nReinforcement Learning with Human Feedback: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback involves using human evaluators to assess model outputs for bias and provide feedback to adjust the model's parameters. The model is rewarded for producing unbiased outputs and penalized for biased ones, creating a feedback loop that helps the model learn to avoid generating biased content. This variable is implemented by setting up a framework for collecting human feedback and integrating it into the model's training process. The effectiveness of this approach is measured by the reduction in bias scores, as evaluated by generated-text-based metrics.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, which will automate the integration of Counterfactual Data Augmentation and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback. The process begins with the generation of counterfactual data, where gendered and racial terms in the training dataset are systematically swapped to create balanced examples. This augmented dataset is then used to train a pre-existing language model. The model's outputs are evaluated using generated-text-based metrics to establish a baseline bias score. Next, the Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback component is introduced. Human evaluators will assess the model's outputs for bias, providing feedback that is used to adjust the model's parameters. The feedback loop is set up using a reinforcement learning framework, where the model is rewarded for unbiased outputs and penalized for biased ones. The integration of human feedback is facilitated by a custom-built module that collects and processes evaluator input, adjusting the model's learning strategy accordingly. Throughout the process, the CodeScientist system will manage the execution of experiments, data flow, and evaluation, ensuring that the hypothesis is tested systematically. The final outputs are analyzed to determine the reduction in bias scores, comparing the results against the baseline established with the augmented dataset alone. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is the generated-text-based bias score, which measures the presence of biased language or stereotypes in model outputs. This score is calculated by generating text from the model using prompts designed to elicit biased responses and evaluating the content using automated classifiers. The classifiers are trained to detect specific types of bias, such as gender and racial bias, and assign scores based on the presence and severity of biased content. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the bias scores of the model trained with Counterfactual Data Augmentation alone against the scores after integrating Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback. A significant reduction in bias scores will indicate the effectiveness of the combined approach. The evaluation will include multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence and account for variability in human feedback.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment series investigating bias mitigation in language models using Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF).

The Bonito model is designed to convert unannotated legal texts into task-specific training datasets, leveraging the CTGA dataset to generate diverse and abundant examples. This approach aims to reduce the dependency on manually curated legal datasets, which are often scarce and expensive to obtain. By employing the Bonito model, the research hypothesizes that the language model can achieve accuracy metrics comparable to those of models trained on high-quality, manually curated legal datasets. The study will focus on evaluating the model's performance in legal question-answering tasks, using accuracy as the primary metric. This approach addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high costs associated with manual data curation, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for legal domain adaptation. \nKey Variables:\nBonito Model: The Bonito model is an open-source system that transforms unannotated legal text into structured datasets for instruction tuning. It uses the CTGA dataset to generate instructions referencing the text and a target response, creating diverse examples for fine-tuning. This model is selected for its ability to automate data generation in specialized domains, reducing the need for manual curation. In this research, the Bonito model will be configured to process legal texts, generating training datasets that enhance the adaptability of language models to legal tasks. The expected outcome is an improvement in the model's accuracy in legal question-answering tasks, as measured by the proportion of correctly answered questions.\nCTGA Dataset: The Conditional Task Generation with Attributes (CTGA) dataset is designed to train models like Bonito for generating domain-specific instructions. It reorganizes existing instruction tuning datasets into meta-templates that produce training examples with context and task attributes. This dataset is chosen for its ability to create diverse and abundant examples, crucial for adapting language models to specialized domains like law. In this research, the CTGA dataset will be used to generate legal instruction datasets, enabling efficient domain adaptation without manual annotation. The dataset's effectiveness will be assessed by the accuracy of the language model in legal tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, which will automate the experiment process. The Bonito model will be employed to convert unannotated legal texts into structured datasets using the CTGA dataset. The experiment will involve configuring the Bonito model to process legal texts, generating training datasets that will be used to fine-tune a general instruction-tuned language model. The CodeScientist system will handle the execution of the Bonito model, data generation, and subsequent fine-tuning of the language model. The experiment will be conducted in a controlled environment, with the language model's accuracy in legal question-answering tasks being the primary metric of evaluation. The process will involve multiple iterations to ensure robustness and reliability of the results. The final output will be a report detailing the model's performance, comparing it to baseline models trained on manually curated legal datasets. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly answered legal questions by the instruction-tuned language model. The model's performance will be benchmarked against baseline models trained on manually curated legal datasets, such as ChatLaw-MoE. The accuracy will be computed as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of questions posed in a legal Q&A dataset. The experiment will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical significance, with improvements being interpreted as the model achieving accuracy metrics comparable to or exceeding those of the baseline models. Secondary metrics may include precision and recall, providing additional insights into the model's reliability and ability to identify relevant legal instances.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate the Bonito model's effectiveness in legal domain adaptation. The experiment should be implemented as a pilot study with three possible modes (set by PILOT_MODE global variable):\n\nPILOT_MODE Settings:\n1. MINI_PILOT: Use 10 legal questions, from training set only\n2. PILOT: Use 200 legal questions, split between training and dev sets\n3.

Evaluation:\n   - Primary metric: Accuracy (correct answers / total questions)\n   - Secondary metrics: Precision, Recall\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to compare conditions\n   - Generate accuracy plots showing performance differences\n\n5. Output Requirements:\n   - Save all raw responses\n   - Generate summary statistics\n   - Create comparison plots\n   - Statistical significance testing results\n\nInitial Run Instructions:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT mode\n3. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT (await human verification)\n\nLogging Requirements:\n- Log all configuration parameters\n- Log all prompts and responses\n- Log timing information\n- Log all evaluation metrics\n- Log any errors or warnings\n\nError Handling:\n- Implement appropriate error handling for API calls\n- Include timeout mechanisms\n- Save partial results if errors occur\n\nPlease implement this experiment, starting with MINI_PILOT mode.

Semantic Retrieval will be used to select documents based on semantic similarity to the dialogue context, ensuring that responses are grounded in relevant and factual information. The Token-Level Hallucination Critic will evaluate each token in the generated response to identify potential hallucinations, providing real-time feedback or corrections. This combination is expected to enhance the factual accuracy of dialogue systems by ensuring that responses are both contextually relevant and factually correct. The hypothesis will be tested using the BEGIN benchmark and human evaluations, focusing on metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. This approach addresses gaps in prior work by focusing on the synergy between retrieval and hallucination detection, which has not been extensively explored in similar papers. The expected outcome is a significant reduction in hallucinations and an improvement in the overall quality of dialogue responses. \nKey Variables:\nSemantic Retrieval: Semantic Retrieval involves selecting documents based on semantic similarity to the dialogue context. It uses vector embeddings to represent both the dialogue context and potential knowledge sources, allowing for efficient comparison and retrieval of semantically relevant documents. This technique ensures that the responses are grounded in factual information, helping to reduce hallucinations by providing contextually relevant knowledge. In this research, Semantic Retrieval will be implemented using vector embeddings and a learned matching function to select the most relevant documents for each dialogue context. This approach was chosen for its ability to maintain conversational coherence while integrating factual knowledge, which is crucial for improving the factual accuracy of dialogue systems.\nToken-Level Hallucination Critic: The Token-Level Hallucination Critic is a mechanism that evaluates each token in a generated response to identify potential hallucinations. It uses a model trained to detect inconsistencies or inaccuracies at the token level, often employing techniques like attention mechanisms to focus on critical parts of the input. The critic provides feedback or corrections in real-time, enhancing the factual accuracy of dialogue systems. In this research, the Token-Level Hallucination Critic will be implemented as part of the dialogue system, providing real-time feedback on potential hallucinations. This approach was chosen for its ability to provide fine-grained detection and correction of hallucinations, which is essential for improving the factual accuracy of dialogue systems.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities, integrating Semantic Retrieval and a Token-Level Hallucination Critic into the dialogue system. The Semantic Retrieval component will be implemented using vector embeddings and a learned matching function to select the most relevant documents for each dialogue context. This will involve creating a retrieval module that processes the dialogue context, generates vector embeddings, and retrieves semantically similar documents from a knowledge base. The Token-Level Hallucination Critic will be implemented as a separate module that evaluates each token in the generated response, using a pre-trained model to detect potential hallucinations. This module will provide real-time feedback or corrections, ensuring that the final response is both coherent and factually accurate. The integration of these components will involve creating a pipeline where the dialogue context is first processed by the Semantic Retrieval module, followed by the generation of a response that is then evaluated by the Token-Level Hallucination Critic. The final output will be a refined response that is both contextually relevant and factually correct. The implementation will involve using existing codeblocks for vector embeddings and attention mechanisms, with additional logic built to integrate these components into a cohesive system. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision, recall, and F1 score, as measured by the BEGIN benchmark. Precision will assess the proportion of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while recall will measure the ability of the dialogue system to retrieve all relevant instances. The F1 score will provide a harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced measure of the system's performance. Human evaluations will also be conducted using Likert scale ratings to assess the factual accuracy, coherence, and engagement of dialogue responses. The hypothesis will be tested using a control condition where the dialogue system operates without the Semantic Retrieval and Token-Level Hallucination Critic components. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant increase in precision, recall, and F1 score, along with higher Likert scale ratings compared to the control condition.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a dialogue system experiment comparing a baseline system against an experimental system with semantic retrieval and hallucination detection. The experiment should be implemented with three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) as follows:\n\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Use 5 dialogue examples from the BEGIN benchmark training set\n- Maximum 3 turns per dialogue\n- Run each dialogue example twice (baseline and experimental)\n\nPILOT:\n- Use 50 dialogue examples from BEGIN benchmark training set\n- Maximum 5 turns per dialogue\n- Run each dialogue example twice (baseline and experimental)\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n- Use full BEGIN benchmark dataset (training/dev/test as appropriate)\n- No turn limit per dialogue\n- Run each dialogue example twice (baseline and experimental)\n\nImplementation Details:\n1. Baseline System:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini as the base model\n- Simple dialogue system that takes context and generates response\n- No additional components\n\n2. Experimental System:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini as the base model\n- Add semantic retrieval component:\n  * Generate embeddings for dialogue context\n  * Generate embeddings for knowledge base documents\n  * Use cosine similarity to find most relevant documents\n  * Include top 2 most relevant documents in prompt\n- Add hallucination critic:\n  * For each generated response, use gpt-4o-mini to evaluate each sentence\n  * Critic prompt should ask 'Is this statement supported by the context and retrieved documents?'\n  * If not supported, regenerate that portion of the response\n\n3. Evaluation:\n- For each dialogue example, collect:\n  * Response from baseline system\n  * Response from experimental system\n  * BEGIN benchmark metrics (precision, recall, F1)\n  * Time taken to generate response\n- Compare systems using bootstrap resampling\n- Generate plots of precision/recall/F1 distributions\n\n4. Output:\n- Save all responses and metrics to JSON file\n- Generate summary statistics\n- Run bootstrap comparison between baseline and experimental\n- Create PDF report with results\n\nPlease implement the MINI_PILOT first. If successful, proceed to PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT for human verification.\n\nNote: All LLM calls should use gpt-4o-mini through the proxy server for cost management. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Ethical Alignment Evaluation\nShort Description: Combining RefCLIPScore and WInToRe for comprehensive visual-language model evaluation.\nHypothesis to explore: Combining RefCLIPScore with WInToRe will provide a more balanced evaluation of visual-language models by effectively capturing both visual-language alignment and ethical dimensions, such as gender bias, compared to using RefCLIPScore alone on the PAO-EVALBIAS dataset.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Combining RefCLIPScore with WInToRe\nDependent variable: Balanced evaluation of visual-language models\nComparison groups: Combining RefCLIPScore with WInToRe vs. using RefCLIPScore alone\nBaseline/control: Using RefCLIPScore alone on the PAO-EVALBIAS dataset\nContext/setting: Evaluation of visual-language models\nAssumptions: Combining tools captures both visual-language alignment and ethical dimensions\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Visual-language models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Evaluation on the PAO-EVALBIAS dataset\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of combining RefCLIPScore with WInToRe in assessing visual-language models. RefCLIPScore, which incorporates reference captions to enhance visual-language alignment evaluation, will be used alongside WInToRe, a metric designed to assess ethical dimensions such as bias and toxicity. The hypothesis posits that this combination will provide a more comprehensive evaluation by capturing both alignment and ethical considerations. The PAO-EVALBIAS dataset, which focuses on gender biases, will serve as the testing ground. The expected outcome is that the combined metric will show improved correlation with human judgments and reduced gender prediction errors compared to using RefCLIPScore alone. This approach addresses gaps in existing literature by integrating ethical evaluation into visual-language model assessments, offering a more holistic view of model performance. \nKey Variables:\nRefCLIPScore: RefCLIPScore is an extension of CLIPScore that incorporates reference captions to enhance the evaluation of visual-language alignment. It computes the harmonic mean of the CLIPScore and the maximal reference cosine similarity, using vector representations of each available reference extracted by the CLIP text encoder. This approach allows for a more nuanced assessment by considering both the candidate caption and reference captions, thus improving correlation with human judgments. In this experiment, RefCLIPScore will be used to evaluate the alignment of text-to-image models on the PAO-EVALBIAS dataset, with a focus on capturing visual-language alignment.\nWInToRe: WInToRe is a metric designed to assess ethical dimensions such as bias and toxicity in visual-language models. It evaluates the presence of gender bias by analyzing model outputs on datasets like PAO-EVALBIAS, which includes gender-specific references. The metric measures the frequency and magnitude of gender prediction errors, aiming to minimize these errors to ensure gender-inclusive outputs. In this research, WInToRe will be used alongside RefCLIPScore to provide a comprehensive evaluation of both alignment and ethical dimensions.\nPAO-EVALBIAS Dataset: The PAO-EVALBIAS dataset is specifically designed to evaluate gender biases in model outputs. It includes a variety of captions with gender-specific references, allowing researchers to assess the extent of gender bias in model predictions. The evaluation process involves calculating metrics like RefCLIPScore and WInToRe for both biased and debiased models, and analyzing the differences in scores to determine the presence and magnitude of gender bias. This dataset serves as a benchmark for testing the effectiveness of bias reduction techniques and ensuring gender-inclusive outputs in image captioning models.\n\nImplementation: To implement the hypothesis, the CodeScientist system will be used to evaluate visual-language models using the combined metrics of RefCLIPScore and WInToRe. The RefCLIPScore will be calculated by leveraging the CLIP model to generate embeddings for both text and image, followed by computing the harmonic mean with reference captions. WInToRe will be implemented to assess ethical dimensions by analyzing gender prediction errors on the PAO-EVALBIAS dataset. The integration will involve creating a pipeline where model outputs are first evaluated for alignment using RefCLIPScore, and then assessed for ethical dimensions using WInToRe. The results will be compared against human judgments to validate the effectiveness of the combined metric. The system will automate the process of data input, metric calculation, and result analysis, ensuring a seamless evaluation workflow. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluation will be the correlation of the combined RefCLIPScore and WInToRe metric with human judgments on the PAO-EVALBIAS dataset. This will be measured using correlation coefficients such as Kendall's tau. The secondary metric will be the reduction in gender prediction errors, assessed by comparing the frequency and magnitude of errors in model outputs. Success will be indicated by a higher correlation with human judgments and a significant reduction in gender prediction errors compared to using RefCLIPScore alone.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of combining RefCLIPScore with WInToRe for visual-language model evaluation, with a focus on both alignment and ethical considerations.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: DBT and ToT Integration\nShort Description: Combining DBT and Zero-shot ToT prompting to enhance LLM empathy and reasoning.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) prompting with Zero-shot Tree of Thought (ToT) prompting in large language models will enhance their performance on empathy-based and multi-step reasoning tasks compared to using Zero-shot Tree of Thought prompting alone.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) prompting with Zero-shot Tree of Thought (ToT) prompting\nDependent variable: Performance on empathy-based and multi-step reasoning tasks\nComparison groups: Integrating DBT with ToT prompting vs. using ToT prompting alone\nBaseline/control: Using Zero-shot Tree of Thought prompting alone\nContext/setting: Large language models\nAssumptions: DBT and ToT prompting can be integrated effectively\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Large language models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Performance on tasks\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) prompting with Zero-shot Tree of Thought (ToT) prompting to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on empathy-based and multi-step reasoning tasks. DBT prompting, rooted in cognitive-behavioral techniques, aims to improve emotional regulation and logical reasoning by incorporating principles such as Wise Mind and Observation into the prompting strategy. Zero-shot ToT prompting, on the other hand, allows LLMs to dynamically explore multiple reasoning paths without prior examples, adapting strategies based on the problem at hand. By combining these approaches, the research aims to leverage DBT's emotional and logical balance with ToT's dynamic reasoning exploration. The expected outcome is an improvement in the LLM's ability to generate empathetic and coherent responses, as well as solve complex reasoning tasks. This combination addresses gaps in existing methods by providing a structured yet flexible approach to reasoning and empathy, potentially leading to more human-like interactions and problem-solving capabilities in LLMs. \nKey Variables:\nDialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Prompting: DBT prompting integrates cognitive-behavioral techniques into LLMs to enhance emotional regulation and logical reasoning. It involves using principles such as Wise Mind, Observation, Description, and Effectiveness to construct prompts that guide the model in balancing logical arguments with emotional understanding. This approach is expected to improve the LLM's accuracy on datasets requiring empathy and reasoning by simulating human-like emotional reasoning.\nZero-shot Tree of Thought (ToT) Prompting: Zero-shot ToT prompting is a dynamic strategy that allows LLMs to explore and evaluate multiple reasoning paths without prior examples. It involves dividing tasks into subtasks and dynamically adjusting strategies based on the problem, enabling better decision-making. This approach is particularly effective for tasks requiring complex problem-solving and decision-making, as it allows the model to adapt its reasoning strategy dynamically.\n\nImplementation: The implementation of this hypothesis will involve using existing codeblocks for Zero-shot Tree of Thought (ToT) prompting and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) prompting. The DBT prompting will be integrated into the LLM's input processing pipeline, where prompts will be constructed using DBT principles to guide the model's reasoning process. The Zero-shot ToT prompting will be implemented to allow the model to explore multiple reasoning paths dynamically. The integration will require a glue module to combine the outputs of DBT and ToT prompting, ensuring that the model can balance emotional understanding with logical reasoning. The data flow will involve feeding the input through the DBT prompting module, followed by the ToT prompting module, and finally through the glue module to generate the final output. The hypothesis will be realized by setting up the LLM with these integrated modules and testing its performance on empathy-based and multi-step reasoning tasks. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be user satisfaction surveys and empathy task datasets. User satisfaction surveys will measure the perceived empathy and coherence of the LLM's responses, while empathy task datasets will evaluate the model's ability to generate responses that align with the empathetic tone and content of the dataset. The secondary metric will be the model's performance on multi-step reasoning tasks, assessed using benchmarks like GSM8K. Improvement will be interpreted as higher user satisfaction scores, better alignment with empathy task datasets, and increased accuracy on multi-step reasoning tasks compared to the baseline condition of using Zero-shot ToT prompting alone.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether integrating DBT principles with Zero-shot Tree of Thought (ToT) prompting improves performance on empathy and reasoning tasks.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Graph-Prompt MWP Solver\nShort Description: Combining graph-based encoding and prompt engineering to enhance MWP solver robustness and accuracy.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating graph-based encoding for entity-aware encoding with prompt engineering for question-guided decoding will improve the robustness and accuracy of Math Word Problem solvers on the SVAMP dataset compared to traditional encoding and decoding methods.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating graph-based encoding with prompt engineering\nDependent variable: Robustness and accuracy of Math Word Problem solvers\nComparison groups: Graph-based encoding with prompt engineering vs. traditional encoding and decoding methods\nBaseline/control: Traditional encoding and decoding methods\nContext/setting: SVAMP dataset\nAssumptions: Graph-based encoding and prompt engineering can be effectively integrated\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Math Word Problem solvers\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Comparison of robustness and accuracy metrics\n\nLong Description: Description: This research investigates the impact of combining graph-based encoding for entity-aware encoding with prompt engineering for question-guided decoding on the robustness and accuracy of Math Word Problem (MWP) solvers. Graph-based encoding will be used to represent entities and their relationships as a graph structure, allowing the solver to better understand complex relationships within the problem. Prompt engineering will guide the decoding process by structuring input prompts to focus on the question, ensuring that the solver's attention remains on the core problem. The SVAMP dataset, known for its challenging variations and requirement for deep understanding, will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. By leveraging graph-based encoding, the solver can capture intricate entity interactions, while prompt engineering ensures that the solution aligns with the question's intent. This combination is expected to enhance the solver's ability to handle diverse and adversarial problem scenarios, addressing gaps in existing MWP solvers that often rely on shallow heuristics. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in both accuracy and robustness, demonstrating the potential of these techniques to advance the field of MWP solving. \nKey Variables:\nGraph-based Encoding: Graph-based encoding involves representing the entities and their relationships in a math word problem as a graph. Nodes represent entities, and edges represent the relationships or operations connecting them. This structured representation helps the solver process complex relationships more effectively. The implementation requires constructing a graph from the problem text using a parser that identifies entities and their connections. This graph is then used as input to a graph neural network, which processes the information to generate a solution. This method was chosen for its ability to capture complex entity interactions, which are crucial for solving challenging MWPs.\nPrompt Engineering: Prompt engineering involves crafting specific input prompts that guide the language model to focus on the question during the decoding process. This is achieved by structuring the input such that the question is highlighted or repeated, ensuring it remains at the forefront of the model's attention. For example, the prompt might begin with the question, followed by a separator and the rest of the problem context. This method helps maintain focus on the question's requirements, improving the alignment of generated solutions with the question intent. It is particularly useful for ensuring that the solver's attention is directed towards the most relevant parts of the problem.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for graph-based encoding and prompt engineering. The graph-based encoding will be implemented by constructing a graph representation of the problem text, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships. This graph will be processed using a graph neural network to generate a structured representation of the problem. For prompt engineering, input prompts will be crafted to highlight the question, ensuring it remains the focus during decoding. This involves structuring the input such that the question is presented first, followed by the problem context. The SVAMP dataset will be used to evaluate the solver's performance, as it provides a challenging set of problems that require deep understanding and reasoning. The solver's accuracy and robustness will be assessed by comparing its performance on the SVAMP dataset with and without the integration of graph-based encoding and prompt engineering. The expected outcome is an improvement in both accuracy and robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing MWP solvers. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be accuracy, measured as the percentage of correctly solved problems in the SVAMP dataset. Secondary metrics will include robustness, assessed by the solver's performance on adversarial variations within the dataset. The control condition will involve a baseline solver using traditional encoding and decoding methods without graph-based encoding and prompt engineering. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in accuracy and robustness compared to the baseline. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with performance improvements indicating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a comparison between a baseline MWP solver and an enhanced graph-based MWP solver on the SVAMP dataset.

The ProLLM framework utilizes the Protein Chain of Thought (ProCoT) to convert protein signaling pathways into natural language prompts, enhancing the model's ability to process complex biological interactions. By integrating gene expression profiles, which provide temporal and spatial context for protein interactions, and protein domain assignments, which identify functional regions responsible for interactions, the study aims to improve the predictive accuracy of protein-protein interaction models. The hypothesis posits that this integration will lead to a higher F1 score compared to models relying solely on structured data. This approach addresses the limitations of existing models by capturing both the biological context and structural information of proteins, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of protein interactions. \nKey Variables:\nProLLM Framework: The ProLLM framework is a novel approach that leverages large language models to predict protein-protein interactions by representing protein data in natural language formats. It includes the Protein Chain of Thought (ProCoT) to convert multi-step protein signaling pathways into sequential natural language prompts. This framework is integrated with protein-specific embeddings from ProtTrans and fine-tuned on protein knowledge datasets. The ProLLM framework is selected for its ability to process complex biological interactions and enhance prediction accuracy.\nGene Expression Profiles: Gene expression profiles provide dynamic insights into protein activity, offering temporal and spatial context for protein interactions. This data is obtained through high-throughput techniques like RNA sequencing, measuring gene expression levels across different conditions. By integrating gene expression profiles, the model can capture regulatory networks and pathways governing protein interactions, improving the predictive power of interaction networks.\nProtein Domain Assignments: Protein domain assignments identify functional regions responsible for specific interactions, derived from databases like Pfam or SMART. This data helps in identifying potential interaction sites and understanding the modular architecture of proteins. By incorporating domain information, the model can better account for the structural and functional diversity of proteins, leading to more accurate interaction predictions.\n\nImplementation: The implementation will utilize the ProLLM framework to convert protein signaling pathways into natural language prompts using the Protein Chain of Thought (ProCoT). Gene expression profiles and protein domain assignments will be integrated into the model to provide additional context for protein interactions. The experiment will involve training the ProLLM framework on datasets containing gene expression and domain data, using the ProtTrans embeddings to enhance the model's understanding of protein attributes. The model's performance will be evaluated using the F1 score, comparing its predictive accuracy against baseline models that use only structured data. The implementation will require building new code to integrate gene expression and domain data with the ProLLM framework, as well as adapting existing codeblocks for data preprocessing and model evaluation. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is the F1 score, which balances precision and recall in predicting protein-protein interactions. The model's performance will be compared against baseline models using only structured data, with improvements in the F1 score indicating successful integration of the ProLLM framework with gene expression profiles and protein domain assignments. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical significance, with thresholds for success defined by a significant increase in the F1 score compared to the baseline.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to test the integration of ProLLM with gene expression and protein domain data for protein-protein interaction prediction.

The DA-MoE module dynamically allocates experts based on token importance, optimizing computational resources by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input sequence. The AsymGQA mechanism, on the other hand, employs an activation-informed merging approach to optimize query head grouping, reducing computational costs while maintaining model performance. By combining these two techniques, the research aims to leverage the strengths of both dynamic expert allocation and efficient query grouping to improve model precision without compromising computational efficiency. Model quantization will be employed to further enhance computational efficiency by reducing the precision of model parameters. This approach addresses gaps in existing literature by exploring a novel combination of DA-MoE and AsymGQA, which has not been extensively tested together, and aims to provide insights into their synergistic effects on sequence modeling performance. \nKey Variables:\nDynamic Attention-based Mixture-of-Experts (DA-MoE): DA-MoE leverages the attention mechanism to dynamically allocate experts based on token importance, enhancing predictive performance and efficiency by focusing computational resources on the most important parts of the input sequence. This is particularly effective for tasks with varying token importance, allowing for more tailored and efficient expert activation. In this experiment, DA-MoE will be implemented by designing a routing mechanism that assesses token importance and dynamically allocates experts accordingly. The expected role of DA-MoE is to improve precision by ensuring that the most relevant experts are activated for each input, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture important sequences.\nAsymmetric Grouped-Query Attention (AsymGQA): AsymGQA is an advanced implementation of the Grouped-Query Attention Mechanism that allows for varying group sizes among query heads. It involves an activation-informed fusion approach where similarity between layers is considered to optimize the grouping. This technique mitigates quality degradation that can occur with naive GQA implementations and enhances model performance while maintaining computational efficiency. In this experiment, AsymGQA will be used to optimize query head grouping, reducing computational costs by operating on groups rather than individual queries. The expected role of AsymGQA is to maintain or improve model performance while reducing computational complexity.\nModel Quantization: Model quantization involves reducing the precision of model parameters to decrease the memory footprint and computational load during inference. This technique will be used to enhance computational efficiency by reducing GPU memory usage and processing time. In this experiment, model quantization will be applied to the integrated DA-MoE and AsymGQA model to ensure that the efficiency gains do not unduly compromise the model's predictive capabilities. The expected role of model quantization is to maintain computational efficiency while supporting the enhanced precision achieved through the integration of DA-MoE and AsymGQA.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating a Dynamic Attention-based Mixture-of-Experts (DA-MoE) module with an Asymmetric Grouped-Query Attention (AsymGQA) mechanism in a transformer-based model. The DA-MoE module will be implemented by designing a routing mechanism that assesses token importance and dynamically allocates experts accordingly. This involves calculating attention weights to determine the relevance of each token and guiding the MoE router in selecting the specific number of experts and which experts to activate. The AsymGQA mechanism will be implemented by employing an activation-informed merging approach to optimize query head grouping, allowing for varying group sizes among query heads. This involves analyzing the activation patterns of attention heads to determine optimal groupings. Model quantization will be applied to the integrated model to enhance computational efficiency by reducing the precision of model parameters. The experiment will be conducted on the MMLU dataset, with precision as the primary metric for evaluating sequence modeling performance. The implementation will involve setting up the transformer-based model with the integrated DA-MoE and AsymGQA mechanisms, applying model quantization, and evaluating the model's performance on the MMLU dataset. The expected outcome is an improvement in precision without compromising computational efficiency. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is precision, which measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model. Precision will be calculated as the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positive and false positive predictions. The experiment will be conducted on the MMLU dataset, which includes a diverse set of questions across various domains. The control condition will be a baseline transformer-based model without the integrated DA-MoE and AsymGQA mechanisms. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher precision score for the integrated model compared to the baseline. The experiment will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results. Computational efficiency will also be assessed by measuring GPU memory usage and processing time, with model quantization expected to maintain or improve efficiency.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment to evaluate the integration of DA-MoE with AsymGQA on the MMLU dataset.

Adaptive memory networks allow the model to dynamically update and utilize relevant past data, while continual learning ensures the model adapts incrementally as new data becomes available. This combination aims to improve precision and recall, crucial metrics for evaluating language models in rapidly changing environments like social media. The study will compare the performance of this integrated approach against static models trained on fixed temporal slices, focusing on precision and recall as primary metrics. The hypothesis is grounded in the need for language models to remain relevant in dynamic environments, addressing limitations in existing static models that fail to adapt to new language trends. By leveraging adaptive memory networks, the model can retain critical past information, while continual learning enables the integration of new data, providing a comprehensive solution to the challenges of evolving language patterns. \nKey Variables:\nAdaptive Memory Networks: Adaptive memory networks involve using a memory module that dynamically updates with new information, allowing the model to retain and utilize relevant past data. This approach is implemented by integrating a memory component into the model architecture, which stores recent data points and retrieves them during inference. The memory is updated in real-time as new data arrives, ensuring the model remains up-to-date with current language trends. This variable is crucial for maintaining a balance between retaining past knowledge and integrating new information, directly influencing the model's ability to handle evolving language patterns.\nContinual Learning: Continual learning involves updating the language model incrementally as new data becomes available, allowing it to adapt to changing language patterns over time. This approach is implemented by maintaining a dynamic dataset that is continuously updated with new text data from sources like social media. The model is retrained periodically or in real-time using this evolving dataset, ensuring it captures the latest linguistic trends. Continual learning is essential for enabling the model to adapt to new data without forgetting previously learned information, enhancing its generalization capabilities.\nPrecision and Recall: Precision and recall are metrics used to evaluate the performance of language models. Precision measures the number of true positive results divided by the sum of true positive and false positive results, while recall measures the number of true positive results divided by the sum of true positive and false negative results. These metrics are particularly important in scenarios where the cost of false positives or missing a positive instance is high. In this research, precision and recall will be used to assess the model's ability to accurately predict language patterns in dynamic environments.\nDynamic Streaming Dataset from Social Media Platforms: This dataset consists of streaming text data collected from social media platforms, known for their rapidly evolving language use. The dataset is used to develop and evaluate dynamic language models that can adapt to changes in language patterns over time. The streaming nature of the data requires models to process examples as they arrive, without the need to store large amounts of data in memory. This dataset is particularly useful for applications that require real-time language understanding, such as predictive text input and machine translation.\n\nImplementation: To implement the hypothesis, the experiment will utilize the adaptive memory networks and continual learning components. The adaptive memory networks will be integrated into the language model architecture to dynamically update and utilize relevant past data. This will involve building a memory module that stores recent data points and retrieves them during inference. Continual learning will be implemented by maintaining a dynamic dataset that is continuously updated with new text data from social media platforms. The model will be retrained periodically or in real-time using this evolving dataset. The experiment will use existing codeblocks for continual learning and build new components for the adaptive memory networks. The dynamic streaming dataset from social media platforms will be used as the input data, and the model's performance will be evaluated using precision and recall metrics. The experiment will compare the performance of the integrated approach against static models trained on fixed temporal slices, focusing on precision and recall as primary metrics. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are precision and recall. Precision measures the number of true positive results divided by the sum of true positive and false positive results, while recall measures the number of true positive results divided by the sum of true positive and false negative results. These metrics will be used to assess the model's ability to accurately predict language patterns in dynamic environments. The experiment will use a dynamic streaming dataset from social media platforms as the benchmark, comparing the performance of the integrated approach against static models trained on fixed temporal slices. Improvement or success will be interpreted as higher precision and recall values compared to the baseline static models. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether integrating adaptive memory networks with continual learning improves language model performance on dynamic datasets. The experiment should be structured in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nPILOT MODES:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 social media posts, process in batches of 2, evaluate every 2 posts\n- PILOT: Use 100 social media posts, process in batches of 10, evaluate every 20 posts\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use 1000+ social media posts, process in batches of 50, evaluate every 100 posts\n\nBASELINE SYSTEM:\nImplement a static language model (`gpt-4o-mini`) that:\n1.

Memory-Augmented Planning equips agents with the ability to store and retrieve contextually relevant information, allowing them to maintain coherent, long-term interactions and adapt dynamically to novel scenarios. By combining this with GPT's decentralized decision-making capabilities, each agent can independently process information and make decisions based on its specific context, leveraging past interactions and outcomes. This integration is expected to improve adaptability by enabling agents to learn from historical data and reduce task completion time by optimizing decision-making processes. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the performance of agents using this integrated approach against those using only decentralized decision-making. Evaluation metrics will include task completion time and adaptability in response to environmental changes, providing insights into the effectiveness of memory augmentation in enhancing agent performance. \nKey Variables:\nMemory-Augmented Planning: Memory-Augmented Planning involves using a structured repository to store and retrieve contextually relevant information, such as past interactions and decisions. This persistent memory is crucial for maintaining coherent, long-term interactions and forms the foundation for personalization in dynamic environments. In this experiment, memory modules will be integrated with GPT models to enhance decision-making by allowing the system to adapt dynamically to novel scenarios. This approach leverages external knowledge sources and integrates reasoning with concrete actions, improving system robustness and adaptability. The effectiveness of this variable will be measured by the system's ability to recall and utilize past experiences to optimize decision-making processes.\nGPT as a Decentralized Decision Engine: GPT as a Decentralized Decision Engine involves using GPT models as the primary decision-makers for each agent within a multi-agent system. Each agent is equipped with its personalized GPT model, allowing for decentralized decision-making. This setup leverages the unique explainability and reasoning capabilities of GPT models, making complex decisions more transparent and comprehensible. The implementation involves cloud-hosted GPT models that optimize actions in real-time, with each agent independently processing information and making decisions based on its specific context and objectives. The effectiveness of this approach will be measured by the agents' adaptability and task completion time in dynamic environments.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for GPT models and memory modules. The experiment will involve setting up a multi-agent environment using Overcooked-AI, where each agent is equipped with a GPT model for decentralized decision-making. Memory modules will be integrated with these models to enable Memory-Augmented Planning. The experiment will be conducted in a containerized environment, with the Experiment Builder automatically creating, running, and debugging the experiment code. Data flow will be managed through a series of API calls and memory retrieval processes, allowing agents to access past interactions and decisions. The integration layer will include glue modules to facilitate seamless interaction between memory modules and GPT models. The experiment will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical significance, with each run capturing task completion time and adaptability metrics. The results will be analyzed to determine the impact of memory augmentation on agent performance, with a meta-analysis conducted across all runs to provide comprehensive insights. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be task completion time and adaptability. Task completion time will be measured by tracking the duration from task initiation to successful completion, providing insights into the efficiency of decision-making processes. Adaptability will be assessed by observing how agents modify their decision-making processes and strategies in response to new information or changes in the environment. The control condition will involve agents using only decentralized decision-making without memory augmentation. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant reduction in task completion time and enhanced adaptability, with multiple runs conducted to ensure reliability. Statistical confidence will be established through appropriate tests, ensuring that the results are robust and generalizable.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing memory-augmented vs non-memory-augmented agents in CookingWorld (from TextWorldExpress).

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Enhanced Medical QA with KG-Prompting\nShort Description: Integrate Knowledge Graph-Based Prompting with RAG to improve medical QA accuracy.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating Knowledge Graph-Based Prompting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation using Vector Stores will improve the factual accuracy and precision of language models in medical question answering tasks compared to models using only Retrieval-Augmented Generation.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating Knowledge Graph-Based Prompting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation using Vector Stores\nDependent variable: Factual accuracy and precision of language models\nComparison groups: Models using Knowledge Graph-Based Prompting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation vs. models using only Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nBaseline/control: Models using only Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nContext/setting: Medical question answering tasks\nAssumptions: The integration of Knowledge Graph-Based Prompting and Vector Stores is feasible and effective\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Language models used in medical question answering\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Not specified\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of Knowledge Graph-Based Prompting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Vector Stores to enhance the factual accuracy and precision of language models in medical question answering tasks. Knowledge Graph-Based Prompting involves using structured prompts derived from knowledge graphs to guide language model responses, ensuring they are grounded in established medical facts. RAG with Vector Stores allows language models to access both structured and unstructured medical data, providing a rich context for generating accurate responses. By combining these methods, the research aims to leverage the structured knowledge of knowledge graphs and the comprehensive data access of RAG to improve the reliability of language model outputs. This approach addresses the limitations of existing models that often struggle with factual inaccuracies and hallucinations, particularly in domain-specific tasks like medical question answering. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in the precision and factual accuracy of generated responses, making the model more reliable for medical professionals and researchers. \nKey Variables:\nKnowledge Graph-Based Prompting: This variable involves using knowledge graphs to provide structured prompts that guide language model responses. The knowledge graphs contain medical ontologies and structured information that ground the model's responses in factual medical knowledge. This approach ensures that the language model's outputs are consistent with established medical facts, reducing the risk of hallucinations. The effectiveness of this variable will be measured by the improvement in factual accuracy and precision of the model's responses in medical question answering tasks.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation with Vector Stores: This variable involves integrating vector stores with knowledge graphs to enhance the context of language models. Vector stores allow for the storage of unstructured medical documents while preserving the semantics of the text, providing a complementary source of information to knowledge graphs. This integration enables language models to effectively address traditional limitations by providing access to both structured and unstructured medical data. The effectiveness of this variable will be measured by the model's ability to retrieve and generate accurate and contextually relevant responses in medical question answering tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating Knowledge Graph-Based Prompting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Vector Stores. The implementation will involve the following steps: 1. Utilize existing codeblocks for RAG with Vector Stores to enable the language model to access both structured and unstructured medical data. This will involve configuring the vector stores to store medical documents and knowledge graphs to provide structured medical information. 2. Develop a new module for Knowledge Graph-Based Prompting, which will generate structured prompts from the knowledge graphs to guide the language model's responses. This module will be built from scratch and integrated with the existing RAG system. 3. Set up a pipeline where the language model first retrieves relevant medical information from the vector stores and knowledge graphs, then uses the structured prompts to generate responses. 4. Implement evaluation metrics to assess the factual accuracy and precision of the generated responses in medical question answering tasks. The implementation will involve using benchmark datasets like MedQA or BioASQ to validate the model's performance. The entire process will be automated using CodeScientist's Experiment Builder, which will create, run, and debug the experiment code in a container. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be factual accuracy and precision. Factual accuracy will be measured by the percentage of correct medical facts in the generated responses, while precision will be assessed by the ratio of relevant instances retrieved over the total number of instances retrieved. The evaluation will involve comparing the performance of the integrated model against a baseline model using only RAG with Vector Stores. Benchmark datasets like MedQA or BioASQ will be used for testing, and statistical analysis will be conducted to determine the significance of the results. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in both factual accuracy and precision, indicating the effectiveness of the integrated approach.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing baseline RAG versus RAG+KG-enhanced medical question answering, with the following specifications:\n\nGLOBAL CONFIGURATION:\n- Create a global PILOT_MODE variable that can be set to 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n- Use the MedQA dataset from Huggingface for evaluation\n\nPILOT MODES:\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Use 10 questions from training set\n- Maximum 2 knowledge graph lookups per question\n- Maximum 3 retrieved documents per question\n\nPILOT:\n- Use 100 questions from training set for initial testing\n- Use 50 questions from dev set for evaluation\n- Maximum 5 knowledge graph lookups per question\n- Maximum 5 retrieved documents per question\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n- Use full training set\n- Use full dev set for parameter tuning\n- Use full test set for final evaluation\n- No limits on knowledge graph lookups or retrieved documents\n\nSYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION:\n1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Momentum Cross-Modal Code Representation\nShort Description: Enhancing code expressiveness with momentum contrastive learning and cross-modal generation using ASTs and comments.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating momentum contrastive learning with cross-modal generation using ASTs and comments will enhance the expressiveness of code representations, leading to improved performance in code completion tasks.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integration of momentum contrastive learning with cross-modal generation using ASTs and comments\nDependent variable: Expressiveness of code representations\nComparison groups: Not explicitly mentioned\nBaseline/control: Not explicitly mentioned\nContext/setting: Code completion tasks\nAssumptions: The integration will effectively enhance expressiveness; enhanced expressiveness will improve performance\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not explicitly mentioned\nTimeframe: Not explicitly mentioned\nMeasurement method: Not explicitly mentioned\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of momentum contrastive learning with cross-modal generation using abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and comments to enhance the expressiveness of code representations in code completion tasks. Momentum contrastive learning, which uses momentum encoders to maintain a stable representation space, will be combined with a cross-modal generation task that involves generating comments from ASTs and vice versa. This combination aims to leverage the structural information from ASTs and the semantic context from comments to create more expressive code representations. The hypothesis is that this integration will lead to improved performance in code completion tasks by providing a richer and more nuanced understanding of code semantics. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods that often treat code and comments separately, failing to capture the full depth of information available in multi-modal data. By combining these techniques, the research aims to demonstrate a significant improvement in code completion accuracy and expressiveness, providing a novel contribution to the field of code representation learning. \nKey Variables:\nMomentum Contrastive Learning: Momentum contrastive learning involves using momentum encoders to learn representations based on samples from both the current and previous mini-batches. This technique is crucial for maintaining a stable representation space over time, which enhances the robustness of embeddings. In this research, momentum contrastive learning will be applied to code representations, allowing the model to recognize semantically equivalent and non-equivalent code snippets. This approach is expected to improve the model's ability to perform code completion tasks effectively by providing a stable and consistent representation space.\nCross-Modal Generation with ASTs and Comments: Cross-modal generation involves using one modality, such as an AST, to generate another modality, like a code comment. This technique leverages the structural information from ASTs and the semantic context from comments to enhance code representation. In this research, cross-modal generation will be used to align representations across different modalities, improving the model's ability to understand and generate code-related content. This approach is expected to enhance the expressiveness of code representations by capturing both the syntactic and semantic aspects of code, leading to improved performance in code completion tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging its capabilities to design, iterate, and analyze experiments expressed as Python code. The implementation will involve integrating momentum contrastive learning with cross-modal generation using ASTs and comments. The momentum contrastive learning component will be implemented using a momentum encoder to learn stable representations of code snippets. This will involve training the model on a dataset of code snippets, using a contrastive loss function to pull similar representations closer and push different ones apart. The cross-modal generation component will involve an encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder processes ASTs and the decoder generates corresponding comments. This will be implemented using existing codeblocks for AST processing and comment generation, with additional logic to integrate these components into a unified framework. The data flow will involve feeding code snippets and their corresponding ASTs and comments into the model, which will then generate expressive code representations. The output will be evaluated using code completion tasks, measuring the accuracy and expressiveness of the generated code. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be code completion accuracy, measured as the percentage of correctly predicted code tokens or lines. This will be complemented by expressiveness metrics, assessing the richness and detail of the generated code representations. The evaluation will involve comparing the performance of the integrated model against baseline models using standard code completion datasets. Success will be interpreted as a statistically significant improvement in code completion accuracy and expressiveness compared to the baselines. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure robustness, with statistical confidence intervals calculated to assess the significance of the results.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to evaluate whether integrating momentum contrastive learning with cross-modal generation (using ASTs and comments) improves code completion performance. The experiment should have the following components:\n\nPILOT MODES:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 Python code snippets from the training set, 5 epochs, batch size 2\n- PILOT: Use 100 Python code snippets from training set (for training) and 50 from dev set (for evaluation), 10 epochs, batch size 8\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset, 50 epochs, batch size 32\n\nDATASET:\n1.

Generate a detailed report including:\n   - All metrics for both models\n   - Statistical comparison results\n   - Learning curves and distribution plots\n   - Example completions from both models\n\n2. Log files should include:\n   - Full configuration details\n   - All intermediate results\n   - Error messages and warnings\n   - Memory usage statistics\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n1.

Implement proper error handling and logging throughout\n6.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Constrained Hyper-Network Integration\nShort Description: Integrating constrained hyper-network and inference-time prediction for enhanced factual accuracy and temporal relevance.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating KnowledgeEditor's hyper-network with constrained optimization and inference-time weight prediction will enhance a language model's factual accuracy and temporal relevance, as measured by FActScore and Temporal Alignment Score, compared to models using only one of these techniques.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integration of KnowledgeEditor's hyper-network with constrained optimization and inference-time weight prediction\nDependent variable: Language model's factual accuracy and temporal relevance\nComparison groups: Models using only one of these techniques\nBaseline/control: Models using only one of these techniques\nContext/setting: Not explicitly stated\nAssumptions: The integration of techniques will have a measurable impact\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Language models\nTimeframe: Not explicitly stated\nMeasurement method: FActScore and Temporal Alignment Score\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to explore the synergistic effects of combining hyper-network with constrained optimization and inference-time weight prediction on enhancing the factual accuracy and temporal relevance of language models. The hyper-network with constrained optimization is designed to make precise factual updates by focusing on specific knowledge components, ensuring that unrelated knowledge remains unaffected. This approach is computationally efficient and does not require changes to the pre-training process of the language model. On the other hand, inference-time weight prediction allows for real-time adjustments to the language model's factual knowledge, enabling quick updates without retraining. By integrating these two techniques, the research hypothesizes that the language model will achieve higher factual accuracy and better temporal alignment compared to using each technique in isolation. The expected outcome is an improvement in FActScore and Temporal Alignment Score, indicating enhanced factual accuracy and temporal relevance. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing a more efficient and precise mechanism for updating language models, which is crucial for applications requiring up-to-date and accurate information. \nKey Variables:\nHyper-network with constrained optimization: This variable represents the use of a hyper-network trained with constrained optimization techniques to ensure precise factual updates. The hyper-network predicts weight updates at test time, allowing for efficient editing of factual knowledge without requiring a full retraining of the model. This method is computationally efficient and does not necessitate changes to the pre-training process of the language model. The hyper-network is expected to enhance the factual accuracy of the language model by ensuring that updates are focused on specific knowledge components, minimizing the risk of unintended changes to unrelated knowledge.\nInference-time weight prediction: This variable involves using the hyper-network to predict weight updates at inference time, allowing for real-time adjustments to the language model's factual knowledge. This approach enables quick and efficient updates without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. By making predictions at inference time, the method allows the language model to remain up-to-date with minimal computational overhead. The expected role of this variable is to enhance the temporal relevance of the language model by ensuring that the model's knowledge is aligned with the most current facts.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate the hyper-network with constrained optimization and inference-time weight prediction. The existing codeblock for KnowledgeEditor's hyper-network will be adapted to incorporate constrained optimization techniques, focusing updates on specific knowledge components. This will involve setting constraints during the training phase to ensure precise factual updates. Additionally, a new module will be built to enable inference-time weight prediction, allowing the hyper-network to make real-time adjustments to the language model's factual knowledge. The implementation will involve setting up a pipeline where the hyper-network predicts weight updates based on the input query, and these predictions are applied at inference time to update the model's parameters. The data flow will involve passing input queries through the hyper-network, which will analyze the model's structure to determine the necessary weight updates. The outputs will be evaluated using FActScore and Temporal Alignment Score to measure the improvements in factual accuracy and temporal relevance. The setup will include configuring the language model with the integrated techniques, running experiments on benchmark datasets, and analyzing the results to validate the hypothesis. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be FActScore and Temporal Alignment Score. FActScore will measure the factual accuracy of the language model by decomposing the model's output into atomic facts and checking each against a verified knowledge source. Temporal Alignment Score will assess how well the model's outputs align with the correct temporal context of facts. The hypothesis will be tested using benchmark datasets that include time-stamped facts, and the model's predictions will be evaluated against these datasets. Improvement will be interpreted as an increase in FActScore and Temporal Alignment Score compared to baseline models using only one of the techniques. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and success will be indicated by a significant improvement in both metrics.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment to evaluate the integration of constrained hyper-network and inference-time prediction for enhanced factual accuracy and temporal relevance. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (controlled by PILOT_MODE global variable):\n\nPILOT MODES:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 factual statements from training set\n- PILOT: Use 100 factual statements from training set for training, 50 from dev set for evaluation\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset (but do not run this mode initially)\n\nBASELINE CONDITIONS:\n1.

Record FActScore and Temporal Alignment Score\n\nEVALUATION:\n1. Calculate mean and std dev of FActScore and Temporal Alignment Score for each condition\n2. Perform bootstrap resampling to compare:\n   - Integrated vs Hyper-network only\n   - Integrated vs Inference-time only\n3. Generate plots showing:\n   - FActScore distribution across conditions\n   - Temporal Alignment Score distribution across conditions\n\nLOGGING:\n- Log all configuration parameters\n- Log each prediction and its scores\n- Log statistical test results\n- Save plots as PDFs\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nGenerate a results.json file containing:\n{\n    \"conditions\": {\n        \"hyper_network_only\": {\n            \"fact_scores\": [...],\n            \"temporal_scores\": [...],\n            \"mean_fact_score\": X,\n            \"mean_temporal_score\": Y\n        },\n        \"inference_time_only\": {...},\n        \"integrated\": {...}\n    },\n    \"statistical_tests\": {\n        \"integrated_vs_hyper\": {\n            \"fact_score_p\": X,\n            \"temporal_score_p\": Y\n        },\n        \"integrated_vs_inference\": {...}\n    }\n}\n\nRun the experiment first in MINI_PILOT mode. If successful, run in PILOT mode. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT mode - this requires manual verification and activation. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Integrated Consistency Evaluation\nShort Description: Combining Decompose and Aggregate framework with LLM-ACU score for enhanced semantic consistency evaluation.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating the Decompose and Aggregate framework with the LLM Atom-Content-Unit (LLM-ACU) score will enhance the semantic consistency evaluation of LLM outputs in abstractive summarization tasks, leading to improved alignment with human evaluations.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integration of the Decompose and Aggregate framework with the LLM Atom-Content-Unit (LLM-ACU) score\nDependent variable: Semantic consistency evaluation of LLM outputs\nComparison groups: LLM outputs with and without the integration\nBaseline/control: Current semantic consistency evaluation methods\nContext/setting: Abstractive summarization tasks\nAssumptions: The integration will effectively enhance evaluation; human evaluations are a valid standard\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: LLM outputs in abstractive summarization tasks\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Alignment with human evaluations\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to investigate the impact of integrating the Decompose and Aggregate framework with the LLM Atom-Content-Unit (LLM-ACU) score on the semantic consistency evaluation of LLM outputs in abstractive summarization tasks. The Decompose and Aggregate framework breaks down evaluation criteria into individual aspects and aggregates the results to form a comprehensive assessment, enhancing interpretability and consistency. The LLM-ACU score focuses on atomizing summaries into smaller units for granular evaluation of semantic consistency. By combining these techniques, the research seeks to improve the alignment of LLM evaluations with human judgments, addressing limitations in traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU. The expected outcome is a more reliable and nuanced evaluation of semantic consistency, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-generated summaries. This approach addresses gaps in existing literature by exploring a novel combination of techniques that have not been extensively tested together, offering potential improvements in the evaluation of complex NLP tasks. \nKey Variables:\nDecompose and Aggregate Framework: The Decompose and Aggregate framework involves breaking down evaluation criteria into individual aspects and aggregating the results to form a comprehensive assessment. This method enhances interpretability and consistency in LLM evaluations by systematically addressing each evaluation aspect. It is particularly effective for tasks requiring detailed and nuanced consistency assessments. The framework will be implemented by prompting the LLM to propose weightings for different aspects based on their importance in the given context. An external calculation module computes the weighted sum of scores for different aspects, providing an overall evaluation judgment. This framework was selected for its ability to provide a structured evaluation process, addressing limitations in traditional metrics that often fail to capture the nuances of language understanding.\nLLM Atom-Content-Unit (LLM-ACU) Score: The LLM Atom-Content-Unit (LLM-ACU) score focuses on breaking down summaries into smaller, atomized units of content, allowing for a more granular evaluation of each component's relevance and coherence. The score is computed by analyzing these units for semantic consistency and alignment with the overall summary context. This method requires LLMs to perform detailed content analysis, ensuring that each unit contributes meaningfully to the summary's intended message. The LLM-ACU score was selected for its ability to reduce biases that might arise from evaluating summaries as a whole, providing a more reliable measure of summary quality. It directly influences the evaluation of semantic consistency by offering a detailed analysis of content units, complementing the Decompose and Aggregate framework.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating the Decompose and Aggregate framework with the LLM Atom-Content-Unit (LLM-ACU) score. The implementation will involve the following steps: First, the Decompose and Aggregate framework will be set up to break down evaluation criteria into individual aspects. This will be achieved by prompting the LLM to propose weightings for different aspects based on their importance in the given context. An external calculation module will be built to compute the weighted sum of scores for different aspects, providing an overall evaluation judgment. Next, the LLM-ACU score will be implemented to break down summaries into smaller, atomized units of content. This will involve using existing codeblocks for content analysis and semantic consistency evaluation. The LLM will analyze these units for alignment with the overall summary context. The integration of these components will be facilitated by building a glue module that combines the outputs of the Decompose and Aggregate framework and the LLM-ACU score. This module will ensure that the evaluation process is seamless and that the results are aggregated to form a comprehensive assessment of semantic consistency. The implementation will be tested on abstractive summarization tasks using datasets like CNN/Daily Mail, with the goal of improving alignment with human evaluations. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the alignment of LLM-generated evaluations with human judgments, measured using Pearson correlation coefficient. This metric will assess the degree of alignment between the integrated evaluation framework and human evaluations of semantic consistency. The secondary metric will be the improvement in semantic consistency scores, measured using the LLM Atom-Content-Unit (LLM-ACU) score. The hypothesis will be tested on abstractive summarization tasks using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The control condition will be the use of traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU without the integration of the Decompose and Aggregate framework and the LLM-ACU score. Success will be interpreted as a significant improvement in correlation with human evaluations and higher semantic consistency scores compared to the control condition. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with qualitative evaluations derived from human ratings of summary quality.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate semantic consistency in abstractive summarization by comparing a baseline method against an integrated approach. The experiment should follow these specifications:\n\nPILOT MODE SETTINGS:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 5 articles/summaries from the training set\n- PILOT: Use 50 articles/summaries from training set, and 25 from validation set\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset with proper train/dev/test splits\n\nDATASET:\n1. Use the Huggingface Datasets API to load the CNN/Daily Mail dataset\n2. For each mode, select the appropriate number of samples\n\nBASELINE SYSTEM:\n1. Implement a basic semantic consistency evaluator that uses gpt-4o-mini to directly score summary consistency (0-10)\n2. The prompt should ask the model to evaluate how well the summary captures the key information from the source text\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM:\n1. Implement the Decompose and Aggregate framework:\n   - Break article/summary into aspects: main topic, key facts, causal relationships, temporal sequence\n   - For each aspect, get a consistency score (0-10) using gpt-4o-mini\n   - Weight aspects (main topic: 0.4, key facts: 0.3, causal: 0.2, temporal: 0.1)\n   - Aggregate weighted scores\n\n2. Implement the LLM-ACU score:\n   - Use gpt-4o-mini to break summary into atomic content units (one fact/statement per unit)\n   - For each unit, score consistency with source (0-10)\n   - Average the unit scores\n\n3. Combine the scores:\n   - Final score = 0.6 * (Decompose/Aggregate score) + 0.4 * (LLM-ACU score)\n\nHUMAN EVALUATION:\n1. For MINI_PILOT: Get scores (0-10) for all 5 examples\n2. For PILOT: Get scores for 20 randomly selected examples\n3. For FULL_EXPERIMENT: Get scores for 100 randomly selected examples\n\nEVALUATION:\n1. Calculate Pearson correlation between system scores and human scores\n2. Use bootstrap resampling to compare baseline vs experimental correlations\n3. Report mean scores, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients\n\nLOGGING:\n1. Log all system prompts and responses\n2. Log individual aspect scores and atomic unit scores\n3. Log correlation calculations and bootstrap results\n4. For the experimental system, log the weights used and how scores were combined\n\nOUTPUT:\n1. Generate a results file with:\n   - System scores (baseline and experimental)\n   - Human scores\n   - Correlation coefficients\n   - Bootstrap comparison results\n   - Summary statistics\n\n2. Generate a detailed log file with:\n   - All system prompts/responses\n   - Intermediate calculations\n   - Error messages or warnings\n\nRun the experiment in MINI_PILOT mode first. If successful, run in PILOT mode. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT for human verification of results.\n\nNote: All LLM calls should use gpt-4o-mini through the proxy server for cost management. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

Dynamic Metric Selection allows the model to choose relevant evaluation metrics based on task-specific requirements, assigning weights to these metrics to prioritize their importance. This ensures that the evaluation metrics are aligned with the specific requirements of each task, enhancing adaptability and robustness. Contextual Prompt Fine-Tuning involves adjusting prompts based on the context of the task, allowing for more precise control over model behavior. This approach uses learnable prompt tokens that are dynamically adjusted based on task requirements, improving adaptability and robustness. By combining these techniques, the research aims to improve task performance by ensuring that prompts are optimized for the specific requirements of each task, leading to more effective and contextually appropriate responses. This approach addresses the limitations of current prompt evaluation techniques, which often rely on a single metric, hindering comprehensive assessment and adaptability to multi-task optimization. \nKey Variables:\nDynamic Metric Selection: Dynamic Metric Selection involves choosing relevant evaluation metrics based on the specific task requirements and assigning weights to these metrics to prioritize their importance. This process is automated, allowing the model to adapt its evaluation criteria dynamically as it encounters different tasks. This approach is particularly beneficial in multi-task environments where the relevance of features can vary significantly between tasks. By dynamically adjusting the metrics, the model can better assess feature relevance and optimize its performance across diverse scenarios. This method is implemented using a combination of task-aware prompt evaluation and evolution-based prompt optimization, ensuring that the most pertinent features are emphasized during model training and evaluation.\nContextual Prompt Fine-Tuning: Contextual Prompt Fine-Tuning involves adjusting prompts based on the context of the task, allowing for more precise control over model behavior. This approach uses learnable prompt tokens that are dynamically adjusted based on task requirements, improving adaptability and robustness. Implementation includes designing systems that can optimize prompt configurations in real-time, often using gradient-based optimization techniques. Evaluation metrics include task performance improvements and computational efficiency, typically measured by accuracy and response time. This method ensures that prompts are optimized for the specific requirements of each task, leading to more effective and contextually appropriate responses.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate Dynamic Metric Selection and Contextual Prompt Fine-Tuning within an automated prompt optimization framework for sentiment analysis. The Dynamic Metric Selection component will be implemented using task-aware prompt evaluation and evolution-based prompt optimization techniques. This involves setting up a system where the model dynamically selects relevant metrics and assigns weights based on their priority, establishing task-adapted evaluation metrics for subsequent stages. The Contextual Prompt Fine-Tuning component will be implemented using learnable prompt tokens that are dynamically adjusted based on task requirements. This involves designing systems that can optimize prompt configurations in real-time, using gradient-based optimization techniques. The data flow between components will involve the Dynamic Metric Selection component providing task-specific evaluation metrics to the Contextual Prompt Fine-Tuning component, which will use these metrics to optimize prompt configurations. The hypothesis will be realized end-to-end in code by integrating these components within an automated prompt optimization framework for sentiment analysis, using pre-existing models and APIs. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be task-specific accuracy, measured by the model's ability to correctly classify sentiment in a given text. Secondary metrics will include computational efficiency, measured by processing time, and robustness, measured by the model's ability to maintain performance across varied scenarios. The hypothesis will be tested using benchmark datasets for sentiment analysis, with a control condition involving a baseline agent without the Dynamic Metric Selection and Contextual Prompt Fine-Tuning components. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in task-specific accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the baseline, with multiple runs to ensure reliability.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing baseline and experimental approaches to sentiment analysis. The experiment should include the following components:\n\n1. DATASET\nUse the Huggingface Hub to load the 'imdb' dataset, which contains movie reviews labeled as positive/negative sentiment. For MINI_PILOT use 10 examples from the training set. For PILOT use 100 examples from train (for training/tuning) and 50 from validation (for evaluation). For FULL_EXPERIMENT use the full dataset.\n\n2.

EF-Enc is designed to map multi-modal sources into a unified semantic space, addressing modality bias and enhancing evidence selection. Negative Sample Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning further refines this process by incorporating negative samples to improve model robustness against distractors. This combination is expected to outperform EF-Enc alone by leveraging the strengths of both approaches: EF-Enc's ability to integrate multimodal knowledge and the contrastive learning strategy's robustness to noise. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the precision and recall of evidence retrieval using EF-Enc with and without the contrastive learning component, using the HotpotQA dataset as a benchmark. This research aims to address the limitations of current multi-hop QA systems by enhancing their ability to accurately retrieve relevant evidence from multiple sources, thereby improving overall QA performance. \nKey Variables:\nEntity-centered Fusion Encoder (EF-Enc): EF-Enc is a mechanism that integrates multimodal knowledge into pre-trained generation models by mapping multi-modal sources to a unified semantic space. It addresses modality bias in multi-modal retrieval by aligning and fusing multi-modal sources through structured knowledge representations. In this research, EF-Enc will be used to enhance the retrieval of relevant evidence for multi-hop questions on the HotpotQA dataset. The encoder is expected to improve retrieval precision by ensuring that the retrieval process is both precise and comprehensive. The effectiveness of EF-Enc will be measured by its ability to improve precision and recall in evidence retrieval compared to baseline methods.\nNegative Sample Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning: This approach involves using negative samples in a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework to enhance model robustness against noise and interference. By contrasting positive samples (correct evidence) against negative samples (incorrect or misleading evidence), the model learns to distinguish relevant evidence more effectively. In this research, Negative Sample Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning will be integrated with EF-Enc to further improve evidence retrieval precision and recall. The effectiveness of this approach will be measured by comparing the retrieval performance of EF-Enc with and without the contrastive learning component on the HotpotQA dataset.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by integrating the Entity-centered Fusion Encoder (EF-Enc) with Negative Sample Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning for evidence retrieval in multi-hop question answering tasks on the HotpotQA dataset. The implementation will involve the following steps: 1) Use the EF-Enc to map multi-modal sources to a unified semantic space, enhancing the selection of relevant evidence. 2) Implement Negative Sample Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning by incorporating negative samples into the training process to improve model robustness against distractors. 3) Evaluate the combined approach by measuring precision and recall in evidence retrieval on the HotpotQA dataset. The existing codeblock for EF-Enc will be used, while the contrastive learning component will be built from scratch. Data will flow from the EF-Enc to the contrastive learning module, where the model will be trained to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant evidence. The outputs will be evaluated against baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of the combined approach. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision and recall in evidence retrieval on the HotpotQA dataset. Precision will measure the proportion of correctly retrieved evidence out of all retrieved evidence, while recall will measure the proportion of correctly retrieved evidence out of all relevant evidence. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the precision and recall of evidence retrieval using EF-Enc with and without the contrastive learning component. The HotpotQA dataset will serve as the benchmark for evaluation, with improvements interpreted as higher precision and recall compared to baseline methods. Statistical significance will be assessed using standard confidence intervals and p-values.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment comparing evidence retrieval performance between EF-Enc alone (baseline) and EF-Enc with Negative Sample Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning (experimental) on the HotpotQA dataset. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable.\n\nDataset Setup:\n1. Use the Huggingface Datasets API to load the HotpotQA dataset\n2. For MINI_PILOT: Use 10 questions from training set\n3. For PILOT: Use 200 questions from training set (for training) and 50 from dev set (for evaluation)\n4. For FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset (but do not run this mode initially)\n\nImplementation Steps:\n1. Baseline System (EF-Enc alone):\n   - Use gpt-4o-mini as the base model\n   - Implement evidence retrieval using only EF-Enc\n   - Record precision and recall for each question\n\n2. Experimental System (EF-Enc + Contrastive Learning):\n   - Use gpt-4o-mini as the base model\n   - Implement EF-Enc as in baseline\n   - Add Negative Sample Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning:\n     * For each positive evidence example, generate 2 negative samples\n     * Use contrastive loss to train the model to distinguish between positive and negative examples\n   - Record precision and recall for each question\n\n3. Evaluation:\n   - Calculate average precision and recall for both systems\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to determine if differences are statistically significant\n   - Generate plots comparing precision and recall between systems\n   - Log all results, including per-question performance\n\nRequired Output:\n1. A results.json file containing:\n   - Average precision and recall for both systems\n   - Bootstrap resampling results (p-values, confidence intervals)\n   - Individual question results\n\n2. A plots.pdf file containing:\n   - Precision comparison plot\n   - Recall comparison plot\n   - Combined precision-recall curves\n\n3. A detailed log file containing:\n   - All system parameters\n   - Per-question processing details\n   - Any errors or warnings\n\nPlease run the MINI_PILOT first. If successful, proceed to PILOT. Stop after PILOT - do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT (this requires manual verification of pilot results first).\n\nNote: Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM operations to maintain speed and cost efficiency. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

The Constraint Optimization Engine is employed to efficiently handle constraint satisfaction problems, which are common in dynamic environments where multiple constraints must be satisfied simultaneously. The Neural-Symbolic Pipeline using DSPy facilitates seamless interaction between LLMs and symbolic reasoning systems, enhancing spatial reasoning capabilities. By combining these two approaches, the research aims to leverage the structured problem-solving capabilities of the Constraint Optimization Engine with the flexible reasoning framework of the Neural-Symbolic Pipeline. This integration is expected to improve the LLMs' ability to adapt to changing task requirements and reduce the time taken to complete tasks. The study will compare the performance of LLMs using the integrated system against those using only the Neural-Symbolic Pipeline, focusing on metrics such as task completion time and adaptability. This research fills a gap in existing literature by exploring a novel combination of symbolic reasoning techniques and neural-symbolic integration, which has not been extensively tested in similar studies. \nKey Variables:\nConstraint Optimization Engine: The Constraint Optimization Engine is a symbolic reasoning tool used to solve constraint satisfaction problems over finite domains. It formulates problem constraints in a symbolic format and searches for solutions that satisfy all constraints. This engine is particularly useful in dynamic environments where multiple constraints must be managed simultaneously, such as Overcooked-AI. By embedding the engine within the LLM's architecture, it allows the system to handle complex optimization tasks efficiently, reducing the reasoning burden on the LLM and improving task completion time.\nNeural-Symbolic Pipeline with DSPy: The Neural-Symbolic Pipeline using DSPy integrates LLMs with symbolic reasoning systems to enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. It uses DSPy to create a modular pipeline that allows seamless interaction between LLMs and symbolic solvers. The pipeline leverages strategic prompting and feedback loops to improve reasoning performance across different LLM architectures. This setup enhances the system's adaptability by enabling it to handle complex reasoning tasks, making it suitable for dynamic environments like Overcooked-AI.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate a Constraint Optimization Engine with a Neural-Symbolic Pipeline using DSPy. The existing codeblocks for DSPy-based neural-symbolic integration will be utilized to set up the pipeline. The Constraint Optimization Engine will be sourced externally and integrated into the pipeline to handle constraint satisfaction problems. The experiment will involve setting up a dynamic task environment using Overcooked-AI, where the LLM will be tasked with completing various objectives under changing conditions. The pipeline will facilitate interaction between the LLM and the symbolic reasoning systems, while the Constraint Optimization Engine will manage the constraints involved in each task. Data will flow from the LLM to the symbolic solvers via DSPy, with the Constraint Optimization Engine providing solutions to constraint satisfaction problems. New logic will be built to ensure seamless integration of the Constraint Optimization Engine with the existing DSPy pipeline, focusing on efficient data exchange and task management. The experiment will be run multiple times to ensure reliability, with task completion time and adaptability as the primary metrics. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be task completion time and adaptability. Task completion time will be measured by recording the duration from task initiation to successful completion in the Overcooked-AI environment. Adaptability will be assessed by evaluating the LLM's ability to adjust its strategies in response to changing task requirements, measured by the success rate of completing tasks under varying conditions. The control condition will involve using the Neural-Symbolic Pipeline without the Constraint Optimization Engine. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant reduction in task completion time and an increase in adaptability compared to the control condition. Statistical analysis will be conducted to ensure the results are significant, with multiple runs to account for variability.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing a baseline ReAct agent against an enhanced version that incorporates constraint optimization in CookingWorld (a cooking-themed environment in TextWorldExpress that serves as an analog to Overcooked-AI for our pilot experiments).

KAR uses transformer models to generate keywords that augment the retrieval process, while DPR employs dense vector representations to improve retrieval accuracy. By combining these methods, we aim to leverage the strengths of both approaches: KAR's ability to quickly identify relevant contexts and DPR's precision in semantic matching. The hypothesis posits that this integration will lead to higher precision and recall in retrieving low-frequency knowledge, which is often challenging due to sparse data. The study will implement KAR to generate contextually relevant keywords that refine the search space for DPR, thus enhancing the retrieval process. This approach addresses the limitations of using DPR alone, which may struggle with sparse or rare information. By testing this hypothesis, we aim to demonstrate the synergistic benefits of combining KAR and DPR, providing a novel solution for improving retrieval performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. \nKey Variables:\nKeyword Augmented Retrieval (KAR): KAR is a retrieval method that enhances the process by generating keywords using transformer models, which are then used to augment the retrieval queries. This approach is particularly effective in scenarios where classical retrieval methods struggle with sparse information. In this research, KAR will be implemented to generate keywords that refine the search space for Dense Passage Retrieval, improving the precision and recall of the system. The expected role of KAR is to provide additional contextual signals that help in narrowing down the search space, thus enhancing the retrieval process. The effectiveness of KAR will be assessed by measuring improvements in precision and recall when combined with DPR.\nDense Passage Retrieval (DPR): DPR is a retrieval technique that uses dense vector representations to improve retrieval accuracy. It involves encoding both queries and passages into dense vectors using a dual-encoder architecture, allowing for efficient similarity search in high-dimensional space. In this research, DPR will be used as the baseline retrieval method, and its performance will be compared to the integrated approach with KAR. The expected role of DPR is to provide precise semantic matching between queries and passages, which is crucial for retrieving low-frequency knowledge. The effectiveness of DPR will be assessed by measuring precision and recall in retrieving relevant documents.\n\nImplementation: The implementation will involve integrating Keyword Augmented Retrieval (KAR) with Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) to enhance the retrieval of low-frequency knowledge. The process begins with KAR generating keywords using transformer models, which are then used to augment the retrieval queries. These keywords help in refining the search space for DPR, which employs dense vector representations to retrieve relevant passages. The integration will be implemented using Python, leveraging existing libraries for transformer models and dense retrieval. The experiment will involve setting up a benchmark dataset with known relevance labels to evaluate precision and recall. The system will first use KAR to generate keywords for a given query, which will be combined with the original query to form an augmented query. This augmented query will then be processed by DPR to retrieve relevant passages. The results will be compared to those obtained using DPR alone, measuring improvements in precision and recall. The implementation will require building a module to integrate KAR with DPR, ensuring seamless data flow between components. The experiment will be conducted using CodeScientist's Experiment Builder, which will automate the execution and analysis of the experiments. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision and recall. Precision measures the ratio of correctly retrieved relevant documents to the total number of documents retrieved, while recall measures the ability of the system to retrieve all relevant documents. These metrics will be calculated using a benchmark dataset with known relevance labels. The control condition will be the performance of Dense Passage Retrieval alone, while the experimental condition will be the integrated approach with Keyword Augmented Retrieval. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in precision and recall for the integrated approach compared to the baseline. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and results will be analyzed using standard statistical tests to validate the hypothesis.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) with Keyword-Enhanced Dense Retrieval (KAR+DPR) for information retrieval. The experiment should:\n\n1. Dataset Setup:\n- Use the 'ms_marco' dataset from Huggingface, focusing on the 'dev' split\n- Filter for queries that have low-frequency answers (appearing in <1% of passages)\n\n2. Implementation Modes:\nImplement three pilot modes controlled by PILOT_MODE (str):\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 queries, training set only\n- PILOT: Use 100 queries, with 70/30 train/dev split\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset (but don't run this yet)\n\n3. Baseline System (DPR):\n- Implement basic Dense Passage Retrieval\n- Use sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for embeddings\n- Return top-k passages (k=5 for MINI_PILOT, k=10 for others)\n\n4. Experimental System (KAR+DPR):\n- Use gpt-4o-mini to generate keywords for each query\n- Prompt: 'Given the query: {query}\\nGenerate 3-5 relevant keywords that could help find the answer:'\n- Combine original query with generated keywords\n- Use same embedding model as baseline\n\n5. Evaluation:\n- Calculate precision@k and recall@k for each system\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare performance\n- Generate plots showing:\n  * Precision@k comparison\n  * Recall@k comparison\n  * Combined precision-recall curves\n\n6. Logging Requirements:\n- Log all queries and their generated keywords\n- Log retrieved passages for both systems\n- Log precision/recall metrics for each query\n- Log statistical comparison results\n\n7. Output Requirements:\n- Save all plots as PDFs\n- Generate summary statistics table\n- Include bootstrap comparison results\n\nPlease run the MINI_PILOT first. If successful, run the PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT for human verification.\n\nNote: Use try-except blocks with appropriate error logging throughout. All file paths should be relative to the project root. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

LLM-based data cleaning leverages large language models to detect and correct errors in datasets, enhancing data quality by identifying anomalies and inconsistencies. Domain-specific adapter modules are lightweight components added to pretrained language models to specialize them for particular domains, improving model performance on related tasks. By integrating these two techniques, the study aims to enhance the quality of multilingual datasets, thereby improving the BLEU score in machine translation tasks. This approach addresses the challenge of noisy and inconsistent data in multilingual datasets, which can degrade model performance. The hypothesis posits that the combined use of LLM-based data cleaning and domain-specific adapters will outperform the use of domain-specific adapters alone, due to the synergistic effect of improved data quality and domain adaptation. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of this integration using a multilingual dataset and measure improvements in BLEU scores, providing insights into the benefits of combining data cleaning with domain adaptation techniques. \nKey Variables:\nLLM-Based Data Cleaning: LLM-based data cleaning involves using large language models to detect and correct errors in datasets. This technique leverages the language understanding capabilities of LLMs to identify anomalies or inconsistencies within the data. The implementation requires training LLMs on a corpus of clean and noisy data examples, allowing them to learn patterns indicative of errors. The models can then be applied to new datasets to suggest corrections or flag potential issues. This method is particularly useful for handling complex datasets where traditional rule-based cleaning methods may fall short. The effectiveness of LLM-based cleaning is evaluated by comparing the performance of models trained on cleaned versus uncleaned datasets, with improvements in metrics like BLEU score indicating successful error correction.\nDomain-Specific Adapter Modules: Domain-specific adapter modules are lightweight, trainable components added to pretrained language models to specialize them for particular domains. These modules allow for efficient domain adaptation without retraining the entire model. Implementation involves inserting adapter layers into the transformer architecture, which are trained on domain-specific data while keeping the original model weights fixed. This approach enables the model to learn domain-specific features and improve performance on related tasks, such as machine translation. The effectiveness of domain-specific adapters is evaluated by improvements in task performance metrics, such as BLEU score, when compared to models without adapters.\nMachine Translation Performance: Machine translation performance will be measured using the BLEU score, a metric that evaluates the quality of machine-translated text by comparing it to one or more reference translations. The BLEU score considers factors such as n-gram precision and brevity penalty, providing a comprehensive assessment of translation quality. Improvements in BLEU score will indicate the effectiveness of the integrated approach in enhancing machine translation performance on multilingual datasets.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by first applying LLM-based data cleaning to a multilingual dataset. This involves using a pre-trained large language model to identify and correct errors in the dataset, improving its quality. The cleaned dataset will then be used to train a machine translation model with domain-specific adapter modules. These adapters will be integrated into the transformer architecture of the model, allowing it to specialize in the domain of the dataset. The performance of the machine translation model will be evaluated using the BLEU score, comparing the results to a baseline model trained without LLM-based data cleaning. The implementation will involve using existing codeblocks for LLM-based data cleaning and domain-specific adapter integration, with new logic built to handle the data flow between components. The setup will include configuring the LLM for data cleaning, integrating the adapters into the model, and setting up the evaluation framework to measure BLEU scores. This end-to-end process will demonstrate the impact of the integrated approach on machine translation performance. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is the BLEU score, which measures the quality of machine-translated text by comparing it to reference translations. The BLEU score will be calculated for the machine translation model trained with the integrated approach and compared to a baseline model trained without LLM-based data cleaning. Improvements in BLEU score will indicate the effectiveness of the integrated approach. The evaluation will involve running multiple experiments to ensure statistical significance, with results averaged across runs to account for variability. The control condition will be the baseline model without LLM-based data cleaning, providing a direct comparison to assess the impact of the integrated approach.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment to test whether LLM-based data cleaning combined with domain-specific adapters improves machine translation performance. The experiment should include the following components:\n\n1. PILOT MODES:\nImplement a global variable PILOT_MODE with three settings:\n- MINI_PILOT: Process 50 sentences from a multilingual dataset, 5 iterations of cleaning\n- PILOT: Process 500 sentences, 10 iterations of cleaning\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Process the full dataset\nStart with MINI_PILOT, then if successful, run PILOT.

Multimodal Event Transformers are designed to process and integrate information from multiple modalities, such as text and images, allowing systems to handle complex data environments. Prompt-based Techniques for LLMs leverage the contextual knowledge embedded within these models to guide them in extracting relevant information without extensive retraining. By combining these approaches, the research aims to create a robust information extraction system capable of adapting to diverse data formats and domains. This integration addresses the limitations of existing systems that struggle with scalability and adaptability when dealing with varied data types. The expected outcome is a system that can dynamically adjust to new domains and data types, improving efficiency and effectiveness in information extraction tasks. This research fills a gap in the literature by exploring a novel combination of techniques that have not been extensively tested together, providing a promising direction for future advancements in information extraction technology. \nKey Variables:\nMultimodal Event Transformers: Multimodal Event Transformers are transformer-based architectures that process both textual and visual inputs, enabling the extraction of meaningful information from multimodal sources. They are implemented using transformer architectures that integrate information from diverse data types, such as text and images. This approach enhances the system's adaptability to different data formats, improving scalability and effectiveness across various domains. The choice of Multimodal Event Transformers is based on their ability to handle complex data environments, making them suitable for applications requiring the integration of visual and textual information.\nPrompt-based Techniques for LLMs: Prompt-based Techniques for LLMs involve designing specific prompts that guide the LLMs to focus on relevant information extraction tasks, such as named entity recognition and relation extraction. This approach allows systems to adapt to new domains and data types without extensive retraining, improving scalability and flexibility. By leveraging the contextual knowledge embedded within LLMs, these techniques enhance the system's ability to dynamically adjust to diverse data formats and linguistic characteristics. The selection of Prompt-based Techniques is due to their proven effectiveness in enhancing the adaptability of LLMs in information extraction tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by integrating Multimodal Event Transformers and Prompt-based Techniques for LLMs within an information extraction system.

Concurrently, Prompt-based Techniques will be applied to guide the LLMs in focusing on specific information extraction tasks. This will involve designing prompts that leverage the contextual knowledge of LLMs, allowing them to adapt to various domains and data types without extensive retraining. The integration will be achieved by developing a framework that combines these two approaches, ensuring seamless data flow between components. The system will be evaluated based on its ability to handle diverse data formats and improve scalability and efficiency in processing massive datasets. Existing codeblocks for transformer architectures and prompt-based techniques will be utilized, with additional components built to facilitate the integration and evaluation of the combined system. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will include task success rate, adaptability to new data formats, and processing efficiency. The system's performance will be compared against baseline systems using either Multimodal Event Transformers or Prompt-based Techniques alone. The task success rate will be measured by the accuracy of information extraction tasks, such as named entity recognition and relation extraction. Adaptability will be assessed by the system's ability to handle diverse data formats and domains without extensive retraining. Processing efficiency will be evaluated based on the time taken to process and extract information from large datasets. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant increase in task success rate and adaptability, along with a reduction in processing time compared to baseline systems. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate the integration of Multimodal Event Transformers with Prompt-based techniques for information extraction.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Comprehensive LLM Evaluation Framework\nShort Description: Integrate BIAS Benchmark, ROUGE Score, and HALLU-ENTITY for enhanced LLM evaluation.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating the BIAS Benchmark, ROUGE Score, and HALLU-ENTITY into a unified evaluation framework will significantly improve the fairness and reliability of LLM evaluations by providing a comprehensive assessment of bias, token overlap, and hallucination detection compared to using each metric individually.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integration of BIAS Benchmark, ROUGE Score, and HALLU-ENTITY\nDependent variable: Fairness and reliability of LLM evaluations\nComparison groups: Unified evaluation framework vs. individual metrics\nBaseline/control: Using each metric individually\nContext/setting: LLM evaluations\nAssumptions: Integration will lead to significant improvements\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: LLM evaluations\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Assessment of bias, token overlap, and hallucination detection\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to develop a comprehensive evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating three distinct evaluation metrics: the BIAS Benchmark, ROUGE Score, and HALLU-ENTITY. The BIAS Benchmark will be used to detect structural biases across demographic dimensions, ensuring that LLM outputs are fair and equitable. The ROUGE Score will measure token overlap between generated and reference texts, focusing on recall to assess the quality of text generation. HALLU-ENTITY will be employed to detect entity-level hallucinations, ensuring factual accuracy in generated content. By combining these metrics, the framework aims to provide a holistic evaluation of LLMs, addressing bias, content quality, and factual accuracy simultaneously. This integration is expected to yield more reliable and fair evaluations compared to using each metric in isolation. The research will involve implementing these metrics in a Python-based framework, testing them on benchmark datasets, and comparing the results to baseline evaluations using individual metrics. The expected outcome is an improved evaluation process that offers a more nuanced understanding of LLM performance, guiding future model improvements and ethical AI deployment. \nKey Variables:\nBIAS Benchmark: The BIAS Benchmark is a behavior-based evaluation tool designed to detect structural bias across demographic dimensions using 39 statistical tests. It will be implemented by running LLMs through a series of tests that evaluate their responses to prompts involving various demographic attributes. The results will be statistically analyzed to identify disparities in treatment or representation of different groups. This benchmark is chosen for its comprehensive approach to bias detection, providing a quantitative measure of bias that is crucial for ensuring fairness in LLM outputs.\nROUGE Score: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a set of metrics used to evaluate automatic summarization and machine translation by measuring the overlap of n-grams between candidate and reference texts. ROUGE-N will be used to calculate n-gram overlap, focusing on recall to assess the quality of generated summaries or translations. This metric is selected for its ability to provide a detailed analysis of content quality, ensuring that LLM outputs are not only accurate but also contextually relevant.\nHALLU-ENTITY: HALLU-ENTITY is designed for entity-level hallucination detection in LLMs, focusing on factual inaccuracies in generated content. It uses uncertainty-based methods to improve the precision and reliability of hallucination detection. Implementation involves analyzing generated content for entity-level inaccuracies and applying uncertainty scores to flag potential hallucinations. This method is chosen for its focus on factual accuracy, which is critical for ensuring the reliability of LLM outputs in high-stakes applications.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using a Python-based framework that integrates the BIAS Benchmark, ROUGE Score, and HALLU-ENTITY. The BIAS Benchmark will be implemented using existing statistical analysis libraries to evaluate LLM outputs for bias across demographic dimensions. The ROUGE Score will be calculated using the ROUGE-N metric from NLP libraries to assess token overlap and content quality. HALLU-ENTITY will be implemented using uncertainty-based methods to detect entity-level hallucinations, leveraging existing NLP libraries for uncertainty scoring. Data will flow between components through a central evaluation script that orchestrates the execution of each metric, collects results, and aggregates them into a comprehensive evaluation report. The framework will be tested on benchmark datasets, with each component contributing to the overall evaluation by addressing specific aspects of LLM performance: bias detection, content quality, and factual accuracy. The integration will involve building glue modules to ensure seamless data flow and result aggregation, providing a unified evaluation output. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be the reduction in bias as measured by the BIAS Benchmark, the improvement in token overlap as measured by the ROUGE Score, and the reduction in hallucinations as measured by HALLU-ENTITY. The framework will be tested on benchmark datasets, with a control condition using individual metrics separately. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant reduction in bias and hallucinations, and an increase in token overlap compared to baseline evaluations. Statistical tests will be used to assess the significance of improvements, with multiple runs to ensure reliability. Qualitative evaluations will be derived from the aggregated results, providing a comprehensive assessment of LLM performance.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated LLM evaluation framework. The experiment should compare individual metrics versus an integrated approach.\n\nGlobal Configuration:\n- Set PILOT_MODE as a global variable that can be 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n\nDataset Generation:\n1. Create a small evaluation dataset with the following:\n   - For MINI_PILOT: 5 diverse prompts\n   - For PILOT: 25 diverse prompts\n   - For FULL_EXPERIMENT: 100 diverse prompts\n   Prompts should cover different tasks (e.g., summarization, question answering, factual generation)\n\nMetrics Implementation:\n1. ROUGE Score:\n   - Implement ROUGE-N (n=1,2) calculation\n   - For each prompt, generate text using gpt-4o-mini\n   - Compare against reference texts\n   - Output scores between 0-1\n\n2. BIAS Score (simplified for pilot):\n   - For each prompt, check demographic term frequencies\n   - Calculate representation disparity scores\n   - Output normalized scores between 0-1 (1 = least biased)\n\n3. Hallucination Score (simplified for pilot):\n   - Extract named entities from generated text\n   - Compare against known entity list\n   - Calculate uncertainty scores\n   - Output scores between 0-1 (1 = least hallucination)\n\nExperimental Conditions:\n1. Baseline Condition:\n   - Run each metric separately\n   - Store individual scores\n\n2. Integrated Condition:\n   - Combine metrics using weighted average (initially equal weights)\n   - Apply cross-metric adjustments:\n     * If high bias detected, examine hallucination scores in demographic contexts\n     * If high hallucination detected, examine ROUGE scores for those segments\n\nEvaluation Process:\n1. For MINI_PILOT:\n   - Run 5 prompts\n   - Generate responses\n   - Calculate all metrics\n   - Basic statistical comparison\n   - Generate debug logs\n\n2. For PILOT:\n   - Run 25 prompts\n   - Full statistical analysis\n   - Generate detailed logs and plots\n\n3. For FULL_EXPERIMENT (not to be run initially):\n   - Run full 100 prompts\n   - Comprehensive analysis\n\nRequired Outputs:\n1. Scores for each condition:\n   - Individual metric scores\n   - Integrated scores\n   - Statistical comparison using bootstrap resampling\n\n2. Visualization:\n   - Score distribution plots\n   - Metric correlation analysis\n\n3. Logs:\n   - Full trajectory of metric calculations\n   - Error cases and edge cases\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- All metrics successfully calculate scores\n- Statistical comparison completed\n- Clear logging of process\n- Visualization generated\n\nPlease implement the MINI_PILOT first. If successful, proceed to PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT for human verification.\n\nError Handling:\n- Log all errors comprehensively\n- Gracefully handle edge cases\n- Report any metric calculation failures\n\nNote: This is a simplified pilot implementation focusing on core functionality. The full experiment would require more sophisticated implementations of each metric. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

The hypothesis posits that leveraging hierarchical interactions between visual and textual data will provide a more detailed understanding of the relationships between modalities, thereby enhancing retrieval accuracy. The Multi-Modal Encoder processes inputs from both video and text, aligning them into a unified representation. Hierarchical Vision-Text Interactions are employed to capture multi-level semantic concepts, which are expected to improve the model's ability to discern subtle semantic differences between modalities. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods that often overlook the hierarchical nature of interactions, leading to suboptimal alignment and retrieval performance. By focusing on hierarchical interactions, the proposed method aims to provide a richer context for semantic alignment, ultimately improving the effectiveness of video-text retrieval tasks. \nKey Variables:\nMulti-Modal Encoder: The Multi-Modal Encoder is a key component that processes inputs from both video and text modalities, integrating them into a unified representation. This encoder leverages the versatility of transformer architectures to learn modal-invariant representations, facilitating multi-modal learning. The encoder is pre-trained on large-scale video-language datasets to enhance its ability to align and fuse features from different modalities. This component is crucial for capturing the dynamic interactions between video and text, providing a robust foundation for semantic alignment.\nHierarchical Vision-Text Interactions: Hierarchical Vision-Text Interactions are employed to address semantic gaps between visual and textual modalities. This approach involves using pre-trained object detectors to localize objects and construct multi-level semantic concepts. The hierarchical modeling techniques capture fine-grained interactions between visual and textual features, enhancing the model's alignment accuracy and efficiency. This component is expected to improve the model's ability to perform video-text retrieval by providing a more detailed understanding of the relationships between modalities.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using a Multi-Modal Encoder with Hierarchical Vision-Text Interactions. The Multi-Modal Encoder will be built using a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on large-scale video-language datasets to learn the alignment between video and text features. The encoder will process inputs from both modalities, integrating them into a unified representation. Hierarchical Vision-Text Interactions will be implemented using pre-trained object detectors to localize objects and construct multi-level semantic concepts. These interactions will be modeled using hierarchical techniques to capture fine-grained interactions between visual and textual features. The implementation will involve using existing codeblocks for transformer-based architectures and pre-trained object detectors, along with new logic for hierarchical modeling. Data will flow from the video and text inputs through the encoder, with hierarchical interactions applied to refine the alignment process. The hypothesis will be realized end-to-end in code by integrating these components into a cohesive system for video-text retrieval. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be retrieval accuracy in video-text retrieval tasks. This will be measured by the precision and recall of retrieved video-text pairs, with higher values indicating better performance. A secondary metric will be semantic alignment accuracy, assessed by the similarity scores between aligned video and text features. The benchmark tasks will include standard video-text retrieval datasets, with a control condition using a baseline model without hierarchical interactions. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in retrieval accuracy and semantic alignment compared to the baseline, with multiple runs to ensure reliability.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot study comparing hierarchical vs non-hierarchical multi-modal retrieval for video-text pairs. The experiment should have three possible settings controlled by PILOT_MODE (str): 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'.\n\nDataset:\n- Use the Huggingface Datasets API to load the 'UCF101' dataset for video frames, and associated text descriptions.\n- For MINI_PILOT: Use 10 video-text pairs from training set\n- For PILOT: Use 100 video-text pairs from training set, 50 from validation\n- For FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset\n\nModels:\n1.

Experimental Model (Hierarchical):\n- Use gpt-4o-mini to encode text descriptions at multiple levels (sentence, phrase, word)\n- Extract video features at multiple levels (frame sequence, key frames, objects)\n- Use hierarchical attention to combine features at each level\n\nEvaluation:\n- Compute retrieval accuracy (R@1, R@5, R@10) for both models\n- Measure semantic alignment using cosine similarity between text and video features\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare baseline vs experimental performance\n- Generate line plots showing retrieval accuracy across different recall levels\n\nPilot Process:\n1. First run MINI_PILOT:\n- Process 10 video-text pairs\n- Verify all components work\n- Generate preliminary plots\n- Runtime target: 5-10 minutes\n\n2. If MINI_PILOT successful, run PILOT:\n- Process training and validation sets as specified\n- Generate full metrics and plots\n- Perform statistical comparison\n- Runtime target: 1-2 hours\n\n3. Stop after PILOT (do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n\nRequired Outputs:\n1. Log file containing:\n- Full processing details\n- Model parameters\n- Retrieval results per video-text pair\n\n2. Results file containing:\n- Retrieval accuracy metrics\n- Semantic alignment scores\n- Statistical comparison results\n\n3. Visualization file containing:\n- Line plots of retrieval accuracy\n- Semantic alignment distribution plots\n\nPlease implement this experiment using the specified codeblocks, ensuring proper error handling and logging throughout. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Dynamic Prompt Allocation\nShort Description: Exploring DY-NAICL's impact on LLM precision and generalization under distribution shifts.\nHypothesis to explore: The use of DY-NAICL for dynamic prompt allocation will significantly enhance the precision and zero-shot task generalization capabilities of LLMs under subpopulation distribution shifts compared to static prompt optimization methods.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Use of DY-NAICL for dynamic prompt allocation\nDependent variable: Precision and zero-shot task generalization capabilities of LLMs\nComparison groups: DY-NAICL for dynamic prompt allocation vs. static prompt optimization methods\nBaseline/control: Static prompt optimization methods\nContext/setting: Subpopulation distribution shifts\nAssumptions: \nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: LLMs\nTimeframe: \nMeasurement method: \n\nLong Description: Description: This research investigates the impact of using DY-NAICL, a dynamic prompt allocation technique, on the precision and zero-shot task generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) when faced with subpopulation distribution shifts. DY-NAICL employs a meta-controller to dynamically allocate in-context examples based on real-time predictions, optimizing prompt selection for both performance and efficiency. This approach is contrasted with static prompt optimization methods, which do not adapt to changing data distributions. The study aims to demonstrate that DY-NAICL can improve the precision of LLMs by reducing false positives and enhancing zero-shot task generalization by allowing the model to adapt to unseen tasks without additional training. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where data distribution shifts are common, such as in real-world applications involving diverse user inputs. The expected outcome is that DY-NAICL will outperform static methods in maintaining high precision and generalization capabilities across varying data scenarios, addressing limitations identified in prior studies that focus on static prompt optimization. \nKey Variables:\nDY-NAICL: DY-NAICL is a dynamic prompt allocation technique that uses a meta-controller to predict and allocate the most relevant in-context examples for a given task. It adapts to real-time data distribution shifts, optimizing for both performance and efficiency. This method is chosen for its ability to dynamically adjust prompts based on the current task context, which is expected to enhance the precision and generalization capabilities of LLMs. DY-NAICL's adaptability is crucial for handling subpopulation distribution shifts, allowing the model to maintain performance across diverse scenarios. The effectiveness of DY-NAICL will be measured by improvements in precision and zero-shot task generalization, using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.\nPrecision: Precision is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of LLMs by measuring the number of true positive predictions over the sum of true positive and false positive predictions. In this research, precision will be assessed by comparing the LLM's predictions against known labels in a dataset, focusing on reducing irrelevant or incorrect outputs. This metric is particularly important in classification tasks where false positives are costly. Precision will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of DY-NAICL in improving the accuracy of LLMs under distribution shifts.\nZero-shot task generalization: Zero-shot task generalization refers to the ability of LLMs to perform tasks they have not been explicitly trained on, leveraging learned representations and prompt engineering. This capability will be evaluated by testing the LLM on unseen tasks and measuring its performance using metrics such as task success rate and reasoning accuracy. The study will assess whether DY-NAICL can enhance zero-shot generalization by allowing the model to adapt to new tasks without additional training, compared to static prompt optimization methods.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to design, iterate, and analyze experiments. The DY-NAICL technique will be integrated into the LLM's prompt optimization process. The experiment will involve setting up a meta-controller that dynamically selects in-context examples based on real-time task predictions. This will be compared against a static prompt optimization baseline, where prompts remain unchanged regardless of data distribution shifts. The implementation will require building a new module for the meta-controller, which will interface with existing LLM APIs to allocate examples dynamically. The experiment will use benchmark datasets with known labels to evaluate precision and zero-shot task generalization. CodeScientist will automate the experiment setup, execution, and analysis, ensuring that the hypothesis is tested across multiple runs to ensure statistical significance. The results will be compared using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, with the expectation that DY-NAICL will demonstrate superior performance in adapting to distribution shifts. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision and zero-shot task generalization. Precision will be measured by the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positive and false positive predictions, using datasets with known labels. Zero-shot task generalization will be assessed by testing the LLM on unseen tasks and measuring its performance using task success rate and reasoning accuracy. The control condition will be a static prompt optimization method, and improvements will be interpreted as higher precision and better generalization capabilities in the DY-NAICL setup. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with success indicated by significant improvements in the primary metrics compared to the baseline.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a comparison between a DY-NAICL-inspired dynamic prompt allocation system and a static prompt baseline in TextWorldExpress's CookingWorld environment. The experiment should be structured as follows:\n\n1. Environment Setup:\n- Use CookingWorld with 3 rooms, no doors\n- Set PILOT_MODE as a global variable that can be 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'\n- For MINI_PILOT: Use 3 episodes, max 20 steps each, seeds 1-3\n- For PILOT: Use 25 episodes, max 40 steps each, seeds 1-25\n- For FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use 100 episodes, max 50 steps each, seeds 1-100\n\n2.

Evaluation Metrics:\n- Primary metrics:\n  * Task success rate\n  * Partial performance score (0-1)\n  * Number of steps taken per episode\n  * Precision of action selection (valid actions / total actions attempted)\n- Log full trajectories including:\n  * Observations\n  * Scores\n  * Valid actions\n  * Chosen actions\n  * Selected examples (for dynamic system)\n\n5. Analysis:\n- Compare baseline and experimental systems using bootstrap resampling\n- Generate plots showing:\n  * Success rates over episodes\n  * Average steps taken\n  * Precision metrics\n- Save all results to a JSON file including:\n  * All metrics per episode\n  * Statistical comparisons\n  * Configuration details\n\n6. Execution Order:\n1. Run MINI_PILOT first\n2. If successful, run PILOT\n3. Stop after PILOT (await human verification before FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n\nPlease ensure proper error handling and logging throughout. The experiment should be reproducible by setting random seeds appropriately. All trajectories, scores, and analysis should be saved to disk for later analysis.\n\nNote: The dynamic prompt selection should work as follows:\n1. Extract key features from current game state (e.g., objects present, current goal)\n2. Compare these features with the example pool\n3. Select the 3 most relevant examples based on feature overlap\n4. Use these examples in the next prompt to the LLM \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

The F1-score will measure the accuracy of sentiment quad extraction and prediction, while computational time will assess the efficiency of the approach. The dimABSA dataset will be used as the benchmark, with the Hybrid BERT-LLM model serving as the control condition. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher F1-score and reduced computational time compared to the control condition.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Enhanced Academic Retrieval\nShort Description: Integrating RoPE and Knowledge Graphs with BGE-M3 to improve academic query retrieval.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating Rotary Position Embeddings with a Knowledge Graph Implementation in the BGE-M3 model will enhance retrieval accuracy and reduce processing time for academic regulatory queries compared to using the BGE-M3 model without these enhancements.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integration of Rotary Position Embeddings with a Knowledge Graph Implementation\nDependent variable: Retrieval accuracy and processing time\nComparison groups: BGE-M3 model with enhancements vs. BGE-M3 model without enhancements\nBaseline/control: BGE-M3 model without enhancements\nContext/setting: Academic regulatory queries\nAssumptions: The enhancements will have a measurable impact on the model's performance\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Academic regulatory queries\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Comparison of retrieval accuracy and processing time\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) and a Knowledge Graph Implementation to enhance the performance of the BGE-M3 model in retrieving academic regulatory information. The BGE-M3 model, known for its robustness and adaptability, will be augmented with RoPE to efficiently handle long text sequences by maintaining positional information across extended contexts. This is expected to improve the model's ability to process lengthy academic regulatory documents without truncating important content, thus maintaining high retrieval accuracy. Concurrently, a Knowledge Graph Implementation will be developed to create a structured representation of academic auditing concepts and their interrelations. This graph will be dynamically updated with new regulations, allowing the BGE-M3 model to leverage structured information to enhance retrieval accuracy further. The hypothesis posits that the combination of RoPE and a Knowledge Graph will result in superior retrieval accuracy and reduced processing time compared to the baseline BGE-M3 model without these enhancements. This approach addresses gaps in prior work by providing a novel integration of advanced positional encoding and structured knowledge representation, which has not been extensively explored in similar studies. \nKey Variables:\nRotary Position Embeddings: Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) encode positional information within the self-attention mechanism of models like BGE-M3. By using a rotation matrix, RoPE maintains positional information across extended contexts, allowing the model to handle long text sequences efficiently. This is particularly beneficial for processing lengthy academic regulatory documents, as it reduces computational overhead and maintains high retrieval accuracy. RoPE will be implemented by setting parameters like the base frequency during training and inference, optimizing performance on long-text tasks. This specific value is selected for its ability to enhance the model's capacity to represent and retrieve information from lengthy documents, directly influencing retrieval accuracy and processing time.\nKnowledge Graph Implementation: A Knowledge Graph Implementation for academic auditing involves creating a structured representation of academic auditing concepts and their interrelations. Nodes represent key entities such as regulations and compliance requirements, while edges denote relationships like 'requires' or 'complies with.' The graph will be populated using data extracted from academic regulatory documents and enriched with metadata for context. Tools like Neo4j or RDF frameworks will be used to manage and query the graph. This implementation is chosen for its ability to provide structured information that the BGE-M3 model can leverage to enhance retrieval accuracy. The Knowledge Graph directly influences retrieval accuracy by providing a rich, structured context for query processing.\n\nImplementation: The implementation will involve integrating Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) and a Knowledge Graph Implementation with the BGE-M3 model. RoPE will be configured to handle long text sequences by setting appropriate base frequency parameters during training and inference. This will involve modifying the self-attention mechanism of the BGE-M3 model to incorporate RoPE, allowing it to efficiently process lengthy academic regulatory documents. Concurrently, a Knowledge Graph Implementation will be developed using tools like Neo4j or RDF frameworks to create a structured representation of academic auditing concepts. This graph will be dynamically updated with new regulations, providing structured information that the BGE-M3 model can leverage to enhance retrieval accuracy. The integration will involve developing a query interface that allows the BGE-M3 model to interact with the Knowledge Graph, retrieving relevant information based on structured queries. The implementation will be tested using a dataset of academic regulatory queries, with retrieval accuracy and processing time measured using metrics like nDCG and processing benchmarks. The hypothesis will be realized by evaluating the performance of the integrated system against the baseline BGE-M3 model without these enhancements. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be retrieval accuracy and processing time. Retrieval accuracy will be measured using nDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain), which evaluates the relevance of retrieved documents based on their rank. Processing time will be assessed using processing benchmarks that measure the time taken to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. The benchmark tasks will involve a dataset of academic regulatory queries, with the integrated system's performance compared against the baseline BGE-M3 model without RoPE and Knowledge Graph enhancements. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher nDCG score and reduced processing time compared to the baseline, with statistical confidence established through multiple runs and significance testing.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate whether integrating Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) and Knowledge Graphs with the BGE-M3 model improves academic query retrieval.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Enhanced Knowledge Editing in GPT-2\nShort Description: Combining Neighbor-Assisted and Layer-Specific Editing to improve GPT-2 adaptability and reliability.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating Neighbor-Assisted Model Editing with Layer-Specific Parameter Adjustment in GPT-2 models will enhance the generalization score and editing success rate on healthcare and finance datasets, compared to using either technique alone.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integration of Neighbor-Assisted Model Editing with Layer-Specific Parameter Adjustment in GPT-2 models\nDependent variable: Generalization score and editing success rate\nComparison groups: Using Neighbor-Assisted Model Editing alone, Using Layer-Specific Parameter Adjustment alone\nBaseline/control: Using either technique alone\nContext/setting: Healthcare and finance datasets\nAssumptions: The integration will have a measurable impact on the specified outcomes\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: GPT-2 models applied to healthcare and finance datasets\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Not specified\n\nLong Description: Description: This research investigates the combined effect of Neighbor-Assisted Model Editing and Layer-Specific Parameter Adjustment on the adaptability and reliability of GPT-2 models within the healthcare and finance domains. Neighbor-Assisted Model Editing incorporates contextual knowledge during the editing process to prevent OverEdit, ensuring that only the intended knowledge is modified. Layer-Specific Parameter Adjustment focuses on modifying parameters in specific layers to integrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. By combining these techniques, we aim to enhance the model's ability to generalize edited knowledge across diverse paraphrase prompts and maintain a high editing success rate. This approach addresses the limitations of each method when used in isolation, such as the risk of OverEdit in Neighbor-Assisted Editing and the potential for incomplete knowledge integration in Layer-Specific Adjustment. We will test this hypothesis using medical diagnosis datasets and financial forecasting tasks, evaluating performance through metrics like generalization score and editing success rate. This study aims to provide a more robust method for knowledge editing in GPT-2 models, ensuring reliable and adaptable performance in critical domains. \nKey Variables:\nNeighbor-Assisted Model Editing: This technique involves incorporating neighboring knowledge during the editing process to prevent OverEdit, where updates inadvertently alter unrelated knowledge. It is implemented using a transformer-based model where the editing process is guided by a detailed analysis of the model's internal representations. This method is particularly effective in maintaining the stability of the model's predictions across different inputs. In this research, it will be used to ensure that only the intended knowledge is modified, enhancing the model's reliability.\nLayer-Specific Parameter Adjustment: This approach adjusts parameters in specific layers of a language model to integrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. Inspired by the Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) technique, it identifies critical multi-layer perception (MLP) modules for retaining factual information. By focusing on middle layers, this strategy ensures that updates are localized and do not disrupt the model's overall performance. In this study, it will be used to enhance factual association recall, contributing to the model's adaptability.\nGeneralization Score: A metric used to evaluate the adaptability of edited models by assessing their ability to recall facts under diverse paraphrase prompts. It involves presenting the model with various rephrasings of a fact to determine if it can consistently retrieve the correct information. This score is crucial for ensuring that the model's knowledge is robust across different linguistic expressions.\nEditing Success Rate: This metric measures the percentage of successfully recalled edited facts by the model. It involves modifying the model's parameters to incorporate new facts without affecting existing knowledge. The success rate is evaluated by prompting the model with input queries related to the edited facts and checking if the output aligns with the desired modifications.\n\nImplementation: The implementation of this hypothesis will involve using the CodeScientist system to integrate Neighbor-Assisted Model Editing and Layer-Specific Parameter Adjustment in GPT-2 models. We will begin by setting up the GPT-2 model environment using existing codeblocks for model loading and configuration. The Neighbor-Assisted Model Editing will be implemented by analyzing the model's internal representations to identify and integrate relevant contextual information during the parameter update phase. This will involve building a new module to guide the editing process, ensuring that only the intended knowledge is modified. For Layer-Specific Parameter Adjustment, we will use existing codeblocks to identify critical MLP modules and focus on middle layers for parameter modification. This will require building a new component to adjust the feedforward weights, enhancing factual association recall. The data flow will involve loading healthcare and finance datasets, preprocessing them for model input, and applying the combined editing techniques. The output will be evaluated using metrics like generalization score and editing success rate, with results compared against baseline models using either technique alone. This end-to-end implementation will demonstrate the effectiveness of the combined approach in enhancing model adaptability and reliability. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating this hypothesis are the generalization score and editing success rate. The generalization score will be calculated by presenting the model with various paraphrase prompts derived from benchmark datasets like the PROBE SET, measuring the model's performance across these prompts. The editing success rate will be determined by evaluating the percentage of successfully recalled edited facts, using input queries related to the edited knowledge. The control condition will involve baseline models using either Neighbor-Assisted Model Editing or Layer-Specific Parameter Adjustment alone. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant increase in both metrics compared to the baselines, with statistical confidence determined through multiple runs and analysis of variance.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of combining Neighbor-Assisted Model Editing with Layer-Specific Parameter Adjustment in GPT-2 models. The experiment should be implemented with three pilot modes (PILOT_MODE: str = ['MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', 'FULL_EXPERIMENT']).\n\nDataset Setup:\n1.

The Multi-arm Bandit framework dynamically selects retrieval strategies based on query complexity, optimizing the balance between exploration and exploitation to improve efficiency. Binary Token Representations compress model parameters and data representations, reducing memory usage and speeding up processing. By combining these techniques, the research aims to address the limitations of static retrieval systems, which often incur unnecessary computational overhead and fail to adapt to varying query complexities. The expected outcome is a more efficient retrieval process that maintains high relevance and accuracy, particularly in domains where precision is critical. This approach leverages the strengths of both techniques: the adaptability of the Multi-arm Bandit framework and the computational efficiency of Binary Token Representations, providing a novel solution that has not been extensively explored in existing literature. \nKey Variables:\nMulti-arm Bandit-based Framework: The Multi-arm Bandit-based framework is a dynamic retrieval strategy that evaluates multiple retrieval methods for each query, selecting the optimal one based on query complexity. It uses a bandit algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring that retrieval strategies are cost-effective and relevant. This framework is particularly effective in scenarios with varying query complexities, allowing the system to adapt to the specific needs of each query. It is implemented by modeling the retrieval process as a series of decisions, continuously learning from feedback to improve retrieval efficiency and relevance.\nBinary Token Representations: Binary Token Representations (BTR) involve compressing model parameters and data into binary formats, which reduces memory usage and speeds up processing. This technique is implemented by converting model weights and data into binary formats using quantization techniques, ensuring that the compressed data retains as much of the original information as possible. BTR is particularly beneficial in environments with limited computational resources, allowing for the deployment of large models on less powerful hardware without significant performance degradation. It directly influences computational cost by decreasing memory usage and improving processing speed.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating a Multi-arm Bandit-based framework with Binary Token Representations in a retrieval-augmented language model. The Multi-arm Bandit framework will be developed to dynamically select retrieval strategies based on query complexity, using a bandit algorithm to optimize strategy selection. Existing codeblocks for bandit algorithms will be adapted to handle retrieval strategy decisions. Binary Token Representations will be implemented by applying quantization techniques to compress model parameters and data into binary formats. This will involve modifying existing codeblocks for model compression and quantization. The retrieval-augmented language model will be configured to use these components, with data flowing from the query input through the Multi-arm Bandit framework to determine the retrieval strategy, and then through the BTR-enhanced model for processing. New logic will be built to integrate these components, ensuring seamless interaction and data flow. The setup will include training the Multi-arm Bandit framework on a range of query complexities and integrating it with the retrieval-augmented language model framework. The hypothesis will be realized end-to-end in code by leveraging existing codeblocks for retrieval-augmented models, bandit algorithms, and quantization, with additional glue logic to ensure cohesive operation. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be retrieval efficiency, measured by retrieval time and computational cost, and query relevance, measured by precision and recall. Retrieval efficiency will be assessed by comparing the retrieval time and computational cost of the proposed system against a baseline static retrieval system. Query relevance will be evaluated using precision and recall metrics on benchmark tasks in the biomedical and legal domains. The control condition will be a static retrieval system without the Multi-arm Bandit framework and Binary Token Representations. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant reduction in retrieval time and computational cost, along with maintained or improved precision and recall. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with qualitative assessments derived from the relevance of retrieved documents in the context of biomedical and legal queries.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment comparing an adaptive binary retrieval system against a static baseline for biomedical and legal domain queries. The experiment should be implemented with three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) to facilitate rapid testing and validation.\n\nExperimental Setup:\n1.

Metrics to collect for each query:\n   - Retrieval time (milliseconds)\n   - Peak memory usage (MB)\n   - Precision@k (k=5)\n   - Recall@k (k=5)\n\n5. Implementation Steps:\n   a) Initialize logger for tracking experiment progress\n   b) Load queries based on PILOT_MODE\n   c) For each system (baseline and experimental):\n      - Process all queries\n      - Record metrics\n   d) Generate plots comparing:\n      - Retrieval times\n      - Memory usage\n      - Precision/Recall\n   e) Perform bootstrap resampling to test for significant differences\n\n6. Required Output:\n   - CSV file with per-query metrics\n   - Summary statistics for each condition\n   - Plots comparing performance\n   - Statistical significance results\n\n7. Execution Flow:\n   - Start with MINI_PILOT\n   - If successful, proceed to PILOT\n   - Stop after PILOT (await human verification)\n\nPlease implement this experiment, ensuring proper error handling and logging throughout. The implementation should be modular to allow easy modification of parameters and addition of new retrieval strategies. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

Traditional RNN-based models, while effective in capturing sequential dependencies, often suffer from high computational costs due to their non-parallelizable nature. By incorporating linear attention mechanisms, which reduce the quadratic complexity of traditional attention models, this approach aims to maintain the ability to capture complex dependencies while significantly lowering computational demands. The session-based RNNs will model the sequential nature of user interactions within a session, allowing for more accurate predictions of user preferences. This combination is expected to leverage the strengths of both components: the efficiency of linear attention and the sequential modeling capability of RNNs. The hypothesis will be tested using the MovieLens 1M dataset, focusing on precision and recall as metrics for recommendation accuracy and inference time as a measure of computational complexity. This study aims to provide a novel approach to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of recommendation systems, addressing gaps in current literature that often focus on either accuracy or efficiency but not both simultaneously. \nKey Variables:\nLinear Attention Mechanisms: Linear attention mechanisms are employed to address the computational inefficiencies associated with traditional attention-based models. By linearizing the attention computation, these mechanisms reduce the quadratic complexity typically seen in transformer models, making them more suitable for long sequences. This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios where real-time processing is required, as it allows the model to handle large volumes of data with reduced latency. The implementation involves using linear transformations and approximations to maintain the model's ability to capture complex dependencies while significantly lowering computational demands.\nSession-Based Recurrent Neural Networks: Session-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are used to model the sequential nature of user interactions within a session. The RNN captures the dependencies between items interacted with during a session, allowing for more accurate predictions of the next item of interest. Implementation involves training an RNN on session data, where each session is treated as a sequence of interactions. The model can be evaluated using metrics such as session-based precision and recall, comparing its performance against non-session-aware models.\nMovieLens 1M Dataset: The MovieLens 1M dataset is a widely used benchmark in recommendation system research, consisting of 1 million ratings from 6,000 users on 4,000 movies. It is utilized to evaluate the performance of recommendation models by providing a standardized set of user-item interactions. The dataset is typically preprocessed to include standard splits for training, validation, and testing, ensuring comparability with other studies. This dataset choice allows for the evaluation of model scalability and effectiveness in handling large-scale data environments.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating linear attention mechanisms with session-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The implementation will involve the following steps: First, the MovieLens 1M dataset will be preprocessed to create session-based sequences of user interactions. This will involve segmenting user interaction data into sessions based on predefined criteria such as time gaps between interactions. Next, a session-based RNN model will be constructed using existing codeblocks for RNN implementation, which will be adapted to include linear attention mechanisms. The linear attention mechanism will be implemented by modifying the attention layer to perform linear transformations and approximations, reducing the computational complexity of the attention operation. The model will be trained on the session-based sequences, with precision and recall as the primary metrics for evaluating recommendation accuracy. Inference time will be measured to assess computational complexity. The implementation will involve creating glue modules to integrate the linear attention layer with the RNN architecture, ensuring seamless data flow between components. The experiment will be conducted using the Experiment Builder, which will automatically create, run, and debug the experiment code in a container. The results will be analyzed to determine the impact of the integration on recommendation accuracy and computational complexity. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision and recall, which measure recommendation accuracy by assessing the relevance of recommended items. Precision is calculated as the ratio of relevant items recommended to the total items recommended, while recall is the ratio of relevant items recommended to the total relevant items available. Inference time will be used as a measure of computational complexity, assessing the time taken to generate recommendations. The hypothesis will be tested using the MovieLens 1M dataset, with a control condition involving a traditional RNN-based model without linear attention mechanisms. Improvement will be interpreted as higher precision and recall values and reduced inference time compared to the control condition. The experiment will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a comparative experiment between a baseline session-based RNN and a linear-attention-augmented session-based RNN for movie recommendations. The experiment should include the following components:\n\n1. Dataset and Preprocessing:\n- Use the MovieLens 1M dataset (which should be downloaded using the Huggingface Datasets API)\n- Create user sessions by grouping sequential interactions by user\n- Split data into train/validation/test sets (60%/20%/20%)\n\n2.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Integrated Summarization Framework\nShort Description: A framework combining RoBERTa, diverse beam search, and policy gradient training for enhanced summary quality.\nHypothesis to explore: A multi-objective learning framework using RoBERTa with cosine similarity for probabilistic candidate evaluation and diverse beam search for negative sample augmentation, optimized with self-critical policy gradient training, will produce abstractive summaries with improved factual consistency and semantic richness compared to models optimizing these objectives independently.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Multi-objective learning framework using RoBERTa with cosine similarity and diverse beam search, optimized with self-critical policy gradient training\nDependent variable: Abstractive summaries' factual consistency and semantic richness\nComparison groups: Framework vs. models optimizing objectives independently\nBaseline/control: Models optimizing objectives independently\nContext/setting: Not explicitly stated\nAssumptions: The methods and optimizations will lead to improved outcomes\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not explicitly stated\nTimeframe: Not explicitly stated\nMeasurement method: Comparison of factual consistency and semantic richness of summaries\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores a novel combination of techniques to enhance the quality of abstractive summaries. By integrating RoBERTa with cosine similarity for probabilistic candidate evaluation and diverse beam search for negative sample augmentation, the framework aims to leverage the strengths of both methods. RoBERTa's pre-trained language understanding capabilities are utilized to assess the quality of candidate summaries based on their semantic similarity to the source document, while diverse beam search ensures a wide range of candidate summaries, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish high-quality summaries. The self-critical policy gradient training further optimizes the framework by using ROUGE scores as rewards, focusing on long-term coherence and factual consistency. This combination is expected to produce summaries that are not only factually accurate but also semantically rich, addressing gaps in current literature where these components have been explored independently but not in conjunction. The hypothesis will be tested using standard datasets and evaluated on metrics like ROUGE, BERTScore, and QAFactEval, with the expectation of outperforming baseline models that do not utilize this integrated approach. \nKey Variables:\nRoBERTa with Cosine Similarity: RoBERTa is used as a probabilistic candidate evaluation model, encoding both candidate summaries and source documents. The cosine similarity between the encodings of the first tokens of the source document and candidate summary is used to rank summaries. This method leverages RoBERTa's pre-trained capabilities to provide a reference-free assessment of summary quality, focusing on semantic similarity. It is expected to enhance the selection of semantically rich summaries, directly influencing the factual consistency of the output.\nDiverse Beam Search: Diverse beam search is employed for negative sample augmentation, generating a wide range of candidate summaries by penalizing similar sequences. This approach ensures diversity among candidates, allowing the model to learn from a broader spectrum of summary qualities. It is particularly effective in enhancing factuality by providing varied examples for the model to learn from, directly impacting the model's ability to generate factually consistent summaries.\nSelf-Critical Policy Gradient Training: This reinforcement learning technique optimizes ROUGE scores as a reward, enhancing the readability and coherence of generated summaries. By using a mixed training objective, it aligns the model's output with human preferences, focusing on long-term rewards like overall coherence and quality. This method is expected to refine the model's ability to generate summaries that are both factually accurate and semantically rich, complementing the other components of the framework.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities, leveraging existing codeblocks for RoBERTa and diverse beam search. RoBERTa will be used to encode candidate summaries and source documents, with cosine similarity calculated to rank candidates. Diverse beam search will generate a wide range of candidate summaries, ensuring diversity. Self-critical policy gradient training will be applied to optimize the model using ROUGE scores as rewards. The experiment will involve setting up the data pipeline to feed source documents into the summarization model, generating candidate summaries using diverse beam search, and evaluating them using RoBERTa with cosine similarity. The self-critical policy gradient training will refine the model's parameters based on the ROUGE score rewards, iteratively improving the quality of the generated summaries. The final summaries will be evaluated using metrics like ROUGE, BERTScore, and QAFactEval to assess improvements in factual consistency and semantic richness. This setup will require integration of existing codeblocks for RoBERTa and diverse beam search, along with new logic for reinforcement learning optimization. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluation will be ROUGE scores to assess n-gram overlap, BERTScore for semantic similarity, and QAFactEval for factual consistency. The hypothesis will be tested using standard datasets like CNN/DailyMail, with a control condition of a baseline model using independent optimization of objectives. Improvement will be interpreted as higher ROUGE and BERTScore values, and improved QAFactEval metrics compared to the baseline. Statistical significance will be assessed using multiple runs and confidence intervals. Qualitative evaluations will be derived from the consistency of summaries with source documents, ensuring feasibility using the agent's capabilities.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment series comparing baseline and experimental summarization frameworks. The experiment should have three possible modes controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable ('MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', 'FULL_EXPERIMENT').\n\nDataset:\n- Use the CNN/DailyMail dataset from Huggingface Hub\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 5 articles from training set\n- PILOT: Use 50 articles from training set, 25 from validation set\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset (but don't implement this yet)\n\nBaseline System:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini to generate summaries directly from input text\n- Single-pass generation with standard parameters\n\nExperimental System:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini as base model\n- Generate multiple candidate summaries using diverse prompting (3 candidates in MINI_PILOT, 5 in PILOT)\n- Use cosine similarity between article and candidate embeddings to rank candidates\n- Select best candidate based on ranking\n\nEvaluation:\n1. For each article:\n   - Generate summary using baseline system\n   - Generate summary using experimental system\n   - Calculate ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L scores\n   - Calculate BERTScore\n   - Store all metrics\n\n2. Statistical Analysis:\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to compare baseline vs experimental metrics\n   - Report mean, standard deviation, and p-values for each metric\n   - Generate summary tables of results\n\nLogging Requirements:\n- Log all system parameters\n- Log all generated summaries\n- Log all evaluation metrics\n- For experimental system, log candidate rankings\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. Results file containing:\n   - All evaluation metrics per article\n   - Summary statistics\n   - Statistical comparison results\n2. Log file containing:\n   - Full system configuration\n   - All generated summaries\n   - Any errors/warnings encountered\n\nPilot Process:\n1. Run MINI_PILOT first (5 articles)\n2. If successful, run PILOT (75 total articles)\n3. Stop after PILOT - do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT\n4. Human verification required before proceeding to FULL_EXPERIMENT\n\nError Handling:\n- Log all errors with full stack traces\n- Implement appropriate timeouts for LLM calls\n- Save partial results if experiment is interrupted\n\nPlease implement this experiment, starting with MINI_PILOT mode. Report all results and await human verification before proceeding to PILOT mode. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Dynamic Prompt-Tuned Summarization\nShort Description: Enhancing scientific summarization with dynamic weight visualization and prompt-tuning for improved interpretability and ROUGE scores.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating dynamic weight visualization with prompt-tuning for domain adaptation in a summarization model will enhance interpretability and improve ROUGE scores for scientific documents compared to models using dynamic weight visualization alone.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating dynamic weight visualization with prompt-tuning\nDependent variable: Interpretability and ROUGE scores\nComparison groups: Models using dynamic weight visualization with prompt-tuning vs. models using dynamic weight visualization alone\nBaseline/control: Models using dynamic weight visualization alone\nContext/setting: Scientific document summarization\nAssumptions: Prompt-tuning and dynamic weight visualization can be effectively integrated\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Scientific documents\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: ROUGE scores for summarization performance\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of dynamic weight visualization with prompt-tuning for domain adaptation in the context of scientific document summarization. Dynamic weight visualization provides insights into how attention weights are distributed during the summarization process, enhancing interpretability. Prompt-tuning, on the other hand, involves adjusting prompts to better align with domain-specific language, improving the model's adaptability to the scientific domain. By combining these techniques, the study aims to improve both the interpretability of the summarization process and the quality of the summaries as measured by ROUGE scores. This approach addresses the limitations of using dynamic weight visualization alone, which may not fully capture domain-specific nuances. The expected outcome is a more interpretable and accurate summarization model that better handles the complexities of scientific texts, providing a novel approach not extensively covered in existing literature. \nKey Variables:\nDynamic Weight Visualization: Dynamic weight visualization involves creating visual representations of attention weights assigned to text snippets during the summarization process. This technique enhances interpretability by showing which parts of the input text are prioritized by the model. In this research, dynamic weight visualization will be implemented to provide insights into the decision-making process of the summarization model, helping to validate its performance and ensure transparency.\nPrompt-Tuning for Domain Adaptation: Prompt-tuning involves adjusting the prompts used to guide a language model's output, aligning it with the target domain. This method requires designing prompts that incorporate domain-specific cues, which can be manually crafted or optimized. In this study, prompt-tuning will be used to adapt the summarization model to the scientific domain, enhancing its ability to generate summaries that are coherent and contextually relevant. The effectiveness of prompt-tuning will be assessed based on improvements in ROUGE scores and the model's ability to handle scientific terminology.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate dynamic weight visualization with prompt-tuning for domain adaptation. The dynamic weight visualization will be implemented using existing visualization libraries to create graphical representations of attention weights during the summarization process. Prompt-tuning will involve crafting domain-specific prompts to guide the model's output, leveraging existing language models capable of prompt-tuning. The summarization model will be evaluated on a dataset of scientific documents, with ROUGE scores used to assess the quality of the summaries. The integration will be achieved by combining the visualization and prompt-tuning components, ensuring that the model's outputs are both interpretable and domain-adapted. The implementation will involve setting up the model to accept prompts, generating summaries, and visualizing the attention weights to provide insights into the model's decision-making process. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be ROUGE scores, which measure the overlap between the generated summaries and reference summaries. ROUGE scores will be used to assess improvements in summary quality due to prompt-tuning. The interpretability of the model will be evaluated through the clarity and usefulness of the dynamic weight visualizations, providing insights into how the model prioritizes different text snippets. Success will be indicated by higher ROUGE scores compared to a baseline model using only dynamic weight visualization, and by clear visualizations that enhance understanding of the summarization process.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing two scientific document summarization approaches: a baseline using dynamic weight visualization alone, and an experimental condition that combines dynamic weight visualization with prompt-tuning.

Create line plots showing attention weight distributions\n2. X-axis: token position in input text\n3. Y-axis: attention weight\n4. Save plots as PDFs with clear labels\n\nMetrics to Calculate:\n1. ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores\n2. Average attention weight distribution\n3. Statistical significance using bootstrap resampling\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1.

SQP encourages the model to generate and answer its own questions, enhancing its understanding and contextual relevance. Semantic Retrieval complements this by fetching semantically relevant documents to provide additional context, thereby improving the factual accuracy of the model's responses. The hypothesis posits that this combination will outperform standard zero-shot prompting, which relies solely on the model's pre-existing knowledge. By leveraging SQP, the model can engage in a deeper exploration of the input data, while Semantic Retrieval ensures that the information used is both relevant and up-to-date. This synergy is expected to enhance the precision of the model's outputs, making it more reliable for clinical decision-making in gastroenterology. This approach addresses gaps in existing literature by focusing on a novel combination of techniques that have not been extensively tested together in this specific domain. \nKey Variables:\nSelf-Questioning Prompting (SQP): SQP involves crafting prompts that encourage the model to generate and answer its own questions related to clinical scenarios. This strategy enhances the model's understanding by prompting it to explore different aspects of a patient's condition. The expected role of SQP in this research is to improve the model's contextual understanding and relevance, directly influencing the precision of its outputs. SQP will be assessed by measuring the model's ability to generate contextually relevant questions and answers, with success indicated by a higher precision score compared to zero-shot prompting.\nSemantic Retrieval: Semantic Retrieval uses vector embeddings to fetch documents that are semantically relevant to the query. In this research, it will be implemented to provide the LLM with additional context from external knowledge sources, enhancing the factual accuracy of its responses. The specific implementation involves using models like BERT to generate embeddings and retrieve relevant documents. The effectiveness of Semantic Retrieval will be measured by its impact on the precision of the LLM's outputs, with success indicated by a significant improvement over the baseline zero-shot prompting.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate Self-Questioning Prompting (SQP) with Semantic Retrieval. The process begins with crafting SQP prompts that encourage the LLM to generate and answer questions related to gastroenterology scenarios. These prompts will be designed to stimulate the model's internal reasoning and exploration of the input data. Concurrently, Semantic Retrieval will be employed to fetch relevant documents using vector embeddings generated by models like BERT. The retrieved documents will be used as additional context for the LLM's response generation. The integration will be achieved by setting up a pipeline where SQP prompts guide the LLM's reasoning, and Semantic Retrieval provides the necessary factual context. The existing codeblocks for semantic retrieval and LLM interaction will be adapted to ensure seamless data flow and integration. The output will be evaluated based on precision, comparing the enhanced approach against a baseline of zero-shot prompting. The implementation will involve setting up the retrieval system, designing SQP prompts, and configuring the LLM to process and integrate the retrieved information effectively. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is precision, defined as the proportion of correctly generated outputs among all outputs labeled as correct by the LLM. Precision will be measured by comparing the LLM's outputs against a set of expert-validated responses within the gastroenterology domain. The control condition will be standard zero-shot prompting, with the enhanced approach expected to show a higher precision score. Secondary metrics may include recall and F1-score to provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance. Success will be interpreted as a statistically significant improvement in precision over the baseline, with evaluations conducted over multiple runs to ensure reliability and robustness of the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate whether combining Self-Questioning Prompting (SQP) with Semantic Retrieval improves LLM precision in gastroenterology question answering, compared to zero-shot prompting.

The hypothesis posits that by tailoring the language model's output to better suit the specific requirements of knowledge graph construction tasks, the quality of extracted entities and relations will improve. This approach involves fine-tuning a pretrained seq2seq model on the ACE05 dataset, focusing on enhancing precision and recall metrics. Task-aware representations are expected to provide contextual knowledge that helps the model dynamically update and refine the knowledge graph as new data is processed. The motivation for this research stems from the need to improve event extraction performance in scenarios with limited labeled data, where traditional methods often struggle. By leveraging task-aware representations, the model can better generalize across different domains, potentially leading to significant improvements in precision and recall. This research addresses gaps in prior work by focusing on the integration of task-specific knowledge into seq2seq architectures, which has not been extensively explored in the literature. \nKey Variables:\nTask-Aware Representations: Task-aware representations involve tailoring the language model's output to better suit the specific requirements of knowledge graph construction tasks. This approach utilizes large language models to generate representations that are aware of the task context, thereby improving the quality of the extracted entities and relations. The method includes fine-tuning pre-trained language models for specific tasks like named entity recognition and relation extraction, which are crucial for constructing accurate and dynamic knowledge graphs. By incorporating task-specific knowledge, the model can more effectively update and refine the knowledge graph as new data is processed. This variable is crucial as it directly influences the precision and recall of event extraction by providing contextual knowledge that enhances the model's ability to generalize across different domains.\nPretrained seq2seq Architecture: The seq2seq model employs a pretrained seq2seq architecture to generate event graphs from sequential text input. This approach is conceptually simple and does not rely on syntactic dependency information, which distinguishes it from traditional classification-based encoder-only models. The seq2seq model is trained to predict structured event representations by mapping input sequences to graph structures, effectively capturing the relationships between events and their arguments. The model's architecture allows for the integration of domain-specific dynamic knowledge graphs, which can enhance its performance in few-shot event extraction scenarios. This variable is critical as it provides the foundational architecture for event extraction, enabling the integration of task-aware representations to improve performance metrics like precision and recall.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for seq2seq architectures and task-aware representation integration. The seq2seq model will be fine-tuned on the ACE05 dataset, focusing on event extraction tasks. Task-aware representations will be integrated by adapting the model's output to better suit the specific requirements of knowledge graph construction tasks. This involves using existing codeblocks for language model fine-tuning and task-specific representation generation. Data will flow from the input text through the seq2seq architecture, where task-aware representations will be applied to enhance the model's output. New logic layers will be built to dynamically update the knowledge graph as new data is processed, ensuring that the model can generalize across different domains. The implementation will include setting up the seq2seq model, configuring task-aware representations, and integrating these components to test the hypothesis in few-shot scenarios. The expected outcome is an improvement in precision and recall metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of task-aware representations in enhancing event extraction performance. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision and recall, measured on the ACE05 dataset. Precision will assess the accuracy of the model in identifying true positive events out of all predicted positive events, while recall will evaluate the model's ability to identify all relevant events present in the dataset. The seq2seq model with task-aware representations will be compared against a baseline seq2seq model without task-aware integration. Improvement will be interpreted as higher precision and recall scores in the few-shot learning scenarios. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with success indicated by a significant improvement in precision and recall compared to the baseline.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment comparing baseline seq2seq vs task-aware seq2seq for event extraction on ACE05 dataset. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable.\n\nDataset Setup:\n1.

Log file containing:\n   - All system parameters\n   - Individual example results\n   - Aggregate metrics\n   - Statistical comparisons\n\n2. Results file containing:\n   - Precision/recall for both conditions\n   - Bootstrap comparison results\n   - Error analysis (if FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n\nPlease implement and run the MINI_PILOT first. If successful, proceed to PILOT. Stop after PILOT - do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT (this requires manual verification of pilot results first).\n\nError Handling:\n- Log all errors comprehensively\n- For any LLM call failures, retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff\n- Save partial results if execution is interrupted \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

The hypothesis is that such a configuration will enhance the model's ability to focus on the instruction part of the input, thereby improving accuracy and F1 score compared to fixed prompts without explicit answer choices. The study will use pre-trained LLMs and evaluate their performance on a set of zero-shot text classification tasks. The TAPP will be constructed using simple heuristics to include cross-task demonstrations with explicit answer choices, which are expected to guide the model in better estimating the output distribution. This approach addresses the gap in existing research, where the use of explicit answer choices in TAPP has not been extensively explored. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in model performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing zero-shot generalization capabilities. \nKey Variables:\nTask-Agnostic Prefix Prompt (TAPP): TAPP is implemented by including cross-task demonstrations with explicit answer choices. Each demonstration consists of an instruction, input, and output instance, with explicit answer choices provided in the instruction. This configuration is expected to enhance the model's focus on the instruction and improve output estimation. The TAPP is constructed using simple heuristics and is prepended to the input of the LLM during inference. The choice of using explicit answer choices is based on the hypothesis that it will improve the model's ability to learn the correspondence between the instruction and the output, leading to better performance on zero-shot text classification tasks.\nZero-shot Text Classification: This task involves categorizing text into predefined categories without task-specific training data. The model leverages its pre-trained capabilities and the TAPP to generalize across tasks. The task will be evaluated using accuracy and F1 score, with the expectation that the inclusion of explicit answer choices in the TAPP will lead to improved performance compared to fixed prompts without such choices.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for large language model inference and text classification. The TAPP will be constructed using a codeblock that generates cross-task demonstrations with explicit answer choices. This involves selecting a diverse set of tasks and creating demonstrations that include an instruction, input, and output instance, with explicit answer choices in the instruction. The TAPP will be prepended to the input of the LLM during inference. The system will then evaluate the model's performance on zero-shot text classification tasks, measuring accuracy and F1 score. Data flow involves feeding the input text with the TAPP into the LLM, capturing the model's output, and comparing it against the true labels to compute the evaluation metrics. The implementation will require adapting existing codeblocks for TAPP construction and integration with the LLM inference pipeline. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are accuracy and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances, while F1 score provides a balance between precision and recall. The hypothesis will be tested on a benchmark dataset for zero-shot text classification, with a control condition using fixed prompts without explicit answer choices. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in accuracy and F1 score compared to the control condition. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and the results will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the TAPP configuration.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether adding explicit answer choices to Task-Agnostic Prefix Prompts (TAPP) improves zero-shot text classification performance. The experiment should have the following components:\n\n1. PILOT MODE SETTINGS:\n- Create a global variable PILOT_MODE that can be set to 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 examples from the training set\n- PILOT: Use 100 examples from the training set, and 50 from the dev set\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset splits (but do not implement this mode yet)\n\n2.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: ChatGPT-ColBERT Retrieval Enhancement\nShort Description: Integrating ChatGPT and ColBERT to enhance retrieval precision and recall in niche scientific domains.\nHypothesis to explore: Utilizing ChatGPT for synthetic document generation alongside ColBERT for dense passage retrieval will enhance both precision and recall in open-domain question answering tasks within niche scientific domains, as evaluated on a controlled set of queries.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Utilizing ChatGPT for synthetic document generation and ColBERT for dense passage retrieval\nDependent variable: Precision and recall in open-domain question answering tasks\nComparison groups: Not explicitly mentioned\nBaseline/control: Not explicitly mentioned\nContext/setting: Niche scientific domains\nAssumptions: The methods will enhance precision and recall\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not explicitly mentioned\nTimeframe: Not explicitly mentioned\nMeasurement method: Evaluation on a controlled set of queries\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of ChatGPT for synthetic document generation with ColBERT for dense passage retrieval to improve precision and recall in open-domain question answering tasks within niche scientific domains. ChatGPT's conversational capabilities will be leveraged to generate contextually relevant synthetic documents, which will serve as additional training data for retrieval models. ColBERT, known for its late interaction mechanism, will be used to encode queries and documents into contextualized embeddings, allowing for efficient computation of relevance scores. This combination aims to address the scarcity of labeled data in niche scientific domains by augmenting training datasets with high-quality synthetic documents and enhancing retrieval accuracy through ColBERT's advanced retrieval capabilities. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in both precision and recall, as measured by performance on a controlled set of queries. This approach is novel as it combines the strengths of ChatGPT's document generation with ColBERT's retrieval efficiency, providing a robust solution to the challenges faced in niche scientific domains. \nKey Variables:\nSynthetic Document Generation: ChatGPT will be used to generate synthetic documents by responding to specific queries with detailed passages. This involves configuring ChatGPT's settings such as response length and conversational context to ensure the outputs are suitable for training retrieval models. The generated documents will serve as additional training data, particularly beneficial in niche scientific domains where labeled data is scarce. This approach leverages ChatGPT's ability to produce human-like text, enhancing the training datasets for better retrieval performance.\nDense Passage Retrieval: ColBERT will be used as the dense passage retrieval model. It employs a late interaction mechanism to compute similarity scores between queries and documents, enabling efficient retrieval of highly relevant passages. ColBERT's ability to handle large-scale retrieval tasks makes it suitable for enhancing retrieval precision and recall in open-domain question answering tasks. The model will be fine-tuned to prioritize documents with high relevance to the query, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant retrieval.\nPrecision and Recall: Precision will be measured as the ratio of relevant documents retrieved to the total number of documents retrieved, while recall will be calculated as the number of relevant documents retrieved divided by the total number of relevant documents available. These metrics will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the retrieval system in providing relevant context for generation tasks. The performance will be assessed using a controlled set of queries within niche scientific domains.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by first using ChatGPT to generate synthetic documents based on specific queries related to niche scientific domains. These documents will be used to augment the training data for the retrieval model. ColBERT will be employed as the dense passage retrieval model, using its late interaction mechanism to encode queries and documents into contextualized embeddings. The retrieval process will involve indexing the synthetic documents and using ColBERT to compute relevance scores for each query. The system will be evaluated on a controlled set of queries to measure precision and recall. The implementation will involve setting up a pipeline where ChatGPT generates synthetic documents, which are then indexed and retrieved using ColBERT. The data flow will involve feeding queries to ChatGPT, collecting the generated documents, and using ColBERT to retrieve the most relevant passages. The setup will include configuring ChatGPT's response settings and fine-tuning ColBERT to optimize retrieval accuracy. The hypothesis will be realized end-to-end in code by integrating existing codeblocks for ChatGPT and ColBERT, with additional logic for data preprocessing and evaluation. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision and recall. Precision will be calculated as the ratio of relevant documents retrieved to the total number of documents retrieved, while recall will be measured as the number of relevant documents retrieved divided by the total number of relevant documents available. The evaluation will involve a controlled set of queries within niche scientific domains, with performance compared against a baseline retrieval system without synthetic document generation. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant increase in precision and recall compared to the baseline. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with results analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate whether synthetic document generation using gpt-4o-mini can enhance ColBERT's retrieval performance in scientific question answering.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Entity-Sparse Pruned Summarization\nShort Description: Integrating entity inclusion with pruning to enhance summary informativeness and reduce hallucinations.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating the Entity Inclusion Strategy with moderately high sparsity levels in LLMs will produce summaries that are more informative, as measured by ROUGE-2 scores, and exhibit a reduced hallucination rate, as measured by lexical overlap, compared to standard LLM-generated summaries.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating the Entity Inclusion Strategy with moderately high sparsity levels in LLMs\nDependent variable: Summaries' informativeness and hallucination rate\nComparison groups: Summaries produced by the integration strategy vs. standard LLM-generated summaries\nBaseline/control: Standard LLM-generated summaries\nContext/setting: Not explicitly stated\nAssumptions: Not explicitly stated\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not explicitly stated\nTimeframe: Not explicitly stated\nMeasurement method: ROUGE-2 scores for informativeness, lexical overlap for hallucination rate\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of the Entity Inclusion Strategy with moderately high sparsity levels in large language models (LLMs) to enhance the informativeness and reduce the hallucination rate of generated summaries. The Entity Inclusion Strategy iteratively prompts the LLM to incorporate missing salient entities into summaries, ensuring that all critical entities are represented without increasing the summary length. This strategy is combined with pruning techniques that set the model to moderately high sparsity levels, which have been shown to decrease hallucination risks by encouraging reliance on the source document. The hypothesis posits that this integration will lead to more informative summaries, as measured by ROUGE-2 scores, and a reduced hallucination rate, as indicated by higher lexical overlap with the source document. This approach addresses gaps in existing literature by combining entity-focused prompting with sparsity-induced source reliance, aiming to produce summaries that are both dense and factually consistent. \nKey Variables:\nEntity Inclusion Strategy: The Entity Inclusion Strategy involves prompting the LLM to iteratively incorporate missing salient entities into summaries. This is achieved by designing prompts that focus on identifying and including key entities absent in initial summary drafts, maintaining a fixed summary length while increasing information density. This strategy is implemented using a transformer-based model like GPT-4, with prompts designed to highlight entity gaps and guide the model in filling these gaps effectively. The expected role of this strategy is to enhance the informativeness of summaries by ensuring comprehensive entity representation.\nModerately High Sparsity Levels: Moderately high sparsity levels involve adjusting the model's architecture to remove a substantial portion of its weights, creating a sparser network while maintaining performance on downstream tasks. This sparsity level is calibrated to ensure the model relies more on the source document, enhancing factual consistency and reducing hallucination risks. The expected role of this variable is to decrease the hallucination rate by increasing lexical overlap with the source document, thereby ensuring that generated summaries remain faithful to the original content.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist's capabilities, leveraging existing codeblocks for LLM prompting and pruning. The Entity Inclusion Strategy will be implemented using a transformer-based model like GPT-4, with prompts designed to highlight entity gaps and guide the model in filling these gaps effectively. The model will be pruned to moderately high sparsity levels using state-of-the-art pruning methods available in the codeblock library. The process involves generating an initial summary, identifying missing entities, and re-prompting the model to include those entities iteratively. Pruning will be applied to encourage reliance on the source document, enhancing factual consistency. The integration will be tested by generating summaries from a benchmark dataset, measuring informativeness using ROUGE-2 scores and hallucination rate using lexical overlap metrics. The hypothesis will be realized end-to-end in code, with data flowing between components to ensure seamless integration of entity inclusion and pruning techniques. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is ROUGE-2 scores, which measure the overlap of bigrams between generated and reference summaries, indicating informativeness. The secondary metric is lexical overlap, which measures the extent to which the generated summary aligns with the source document, indicating a reduced hallucination rate. The hypothesis will be tested using a benchmark summarization dataset, with a control condition being standard LLM-generated summaries without entity inclusion or pruning. Improvement will be interpreted as higher ROUGE-2 scores and increased lexical overlap compared to the control condition, with statistical confidence assessed through multiple runs.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing standard LLM summarization versus entity-inclusion with pruning summarization. The experiment should have three possible modes controlled by a global variable PILOT_MODE (values: MINI_PILOT, PILOT, or FULL_EXPERIMENT).\n\nDataset:\n- Use the CNN/DailyMail summarization dataset from HuggingFace Hub.\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 5 articles from training set\n- PILOT: Use 50 articles from training set, 25 from validation set\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset (but don't implement this yet)\n\nConditions:\n1. Baseline condition:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini to generate a direct summary of each article\n- Prompt template: 'Please summarize the following article in 3-4 sentences, being as informative and accurate as possible: {article}'\n\n2. Experimental condition (Entity-Inclusion with Pruning):\n- First, extract key entities from the source article using gpt-4o-mini\n- Prompt template for entity extraction: 'Please list the key entities (people, places, organizations, important objects) from this article, one per line: {article}'\n- Generate initial summary using same prompt as baseline\n- Check if all key entities are included in summary\n- If entities are missing, use this prompt: 'Please revise this summary to include the following missing key entities {missing_entities}, while keeping the same length and maintaining coherence: {current_summary}'\n- Apply pruning by setting temperature=0.3 (simulating sparsity-induced source reliance)\n\nEvaluation:\n1. ROUGE-2 scores:\n- Calculate ROUGE-2 between generated summaries and reference summaries\n- Store scores for each condition\n\n2. Lexical Overlap:\n- Calculate ratio of words in generated summary that appear in source article\n- Exclude stop words\n- Store scores for each condition\n\nAnalysis:\n- Calculate mean and standard deviation for both metrics in each condition\n- Use bootstrap resampling to test for significant differences between conditions\n- Generate plots showing the distribution of scores\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. Results file (JSON) containing:\n- All generated summaries\n- ROUGE-2 scores\n- Lexical overlap scores\n- Statistical comparison results\n\n2. Plots (PDF):\n- Box plots comparing ROUGE-2 scores between conditions\n- Box plots comparing lexical overlap between conditions\n\n3.

ESimCSE enhances SimCSE by crafting diverse positive and negative sentence pairs, which is expected to refine sentence embeddings and improve sentiment analysis performance. The Rotten Tomatoes dataset, known for its complex and nuanced language, provides a challenging benchmark for sentiment analysis models. By focusing on precision and recall, the study will assess how well ESimCSE can accurately identify positive and negative sentiments compared to traditional BERT-derived representations. The hypothesis is that ESimCSE will yield higher precision and recall, indicating a more accurate sentiment polarity detection. This research addresses gaps in existing literature by exploring the combination of ESimCSE with a dataset that has not been extensively tested with this method, providing insights into the potential of contrastive learning techniques in sentiment analysis. \nKey Variables:\nContrastive Learning Method: Enhanced SimCSE (ESimCSE) is a contrastive learning method that improves upon SimCSE by crafting diverse positive and negative pairs to enhance unsupervised learning capabilities. It uses dropout to create identical sentence pairs, which helps in learning robust sentence embeddings. ESimCSE is designed to address the collapse issue of BERT-derived sentence representations, making them more applicable for downstream tasks like sentiment analysis. In this research, ESimCSE will be used to generate sentence embeddings from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset, aiming to improve sentiment polarity detection.\nDataset Choice: The Rotten Tomatoes dataset consists of movie reviews with associated sentiment labels, known for its complexity due to the subjective nature of reviews and frequent use of sarcasm and nuanced language. This dataset is chosen to evaluate sentiment analysis models that need to handle complex linguistic structures and varied sentiment expressions. It provides a challenging benchmark for models aiming to improve sentiment classification accuracy by capturing subtle sentiment cues in text.\nSentiment Analysis Performance: Precision and recall are the primary metrics for evaluating sentiment analysis performance. Precision measures the accuracy of positive sentiment predictions, while recall assesses the model's ability to identify all relevant positive instances. These metrics are crucial for ensuring that the model accurately identifies positive sentiments without misclassifying neutral or negative sentiments as positive. The study will compare the precision and recall of ESimCSE with traditional BERT-derived representations to determine the effectiveness of ESimCSE in sentiment polarity detection.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, which allows for the design, iteration, and analysis of scientific experiments in Python. The implementation will involve the following steps: 1. Data Preparation: Load the Rotten Tomatoes dataset and preprocess it to ensure consistency in input format. 2. Model Setup: Utilize the ESimCSE model for generating sentence embeddings. This involves configuring the model to use dropout for creating identical sentence pairs and crafting diverse positive and negative pairs for contrastive learning. 3. Sentiment Analysis: Implement a sentiment classifier using the generated embeddings to perform sentiment polarity detection. The classifier will be trained to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments. 4. Evaluation: Measure the precision and recall of the sentiment classifier on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. Compare these metrics with those obtained using traditional BERT-derived representations to assess the improvement brought by ESimCSE. The implementation will leverage existing codeblocks for data preprocessing and model evaluation, while the ESimCSE model will be built using available libraries and resources. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are precision and recall. Precision measures the accuracy of positive sentiment predictions, while recall assesses the model's ability to identify all relevant positive instances. The Rotten Tomatoes dataset will serve as the benchmark for evaluation. The control condition will be the performance of traditional BERT-derived representations on the same dataset. Improvement will be interpreted as higher precision and recall for ESimCSE compared to the baseline. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment comparing ESimCSE versus traditional BERT embeddings for sentiment analysis on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. The experiment should be implemented as a pilot study with three possible settings (PILOT_MODE: 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT').\n\nDataset:\n1. Use the Huggingface Hub API to load the Rotten Tomatoes dataset\n2. For MINI_PILOT, use 10 reviews from the training set\n3. For PILOT, use 200 reviews from training set (for training) and 100 from validation set (for evaluation)\n4. For FULL_EXPERIMENT, use the complete dataset\n\nBaseline Implementation (BERT):\n1. Use gpt-4o-mini to generate embeddings for the reviews\n2. Train a simple classifier (e.g., logistic regression) on these embeddings\n\nExperimental Implementation (ESimCSE):\n1. Use gpt-4o-mini to generate embeddings, but with the ESimCSE approach:\n   - For each input, create an identical pair using dropout\n   - Generate diverse positive/negative pairs using the model\n2. Train the same classifier architecture as baseline\n\nEvaluation:\n1. Calculate precision and recall for both conditions\n2. Use bootstrap resampling to determine if differences are significant\n3. Generate a results file containing:\n   - Raw predictions and ground truth\n   - Precision/recall for both conditions\n   - Bootstrap analysis results\n   - Statistical significance (p-value)\n\nLogging:\n1. Log all major steps, including:\n   - Dataset loading and preprocessing\n   - Model training progress\n   - Evaluation metrics\n   - Any errors or warnings\n\nPilot Structure:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT (10 reviews, training set only)\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT (200 train, 100 val)\n3. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT for human verification\n\nPlease ensure all results are clearly logged and saved to files for analysis. The experiment should be reproducible with the same random seed. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1. A report, describing the results of your research. The report should include, among other things, the following parts: Title, Abstract, Introduction, Approach, Experiments, Results, Conclusion, References.\n 2.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Robust Accent Translation\nShort Description: Enhancing speech translation robustness using bilateral perturbation and vector quantization under varying accents.\nHypothesis to explore: Implementing bilateral perturbation alongside vector quantization will enhance the robustness and accuracy of speech-to-speech translation systems, as measured by BLEU scores, in scenarios with varying speaker accents.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Implementing bilateral perturbation alongside vector quantization\nDependent variable: Robustness and accuracy of speech-to-speech translation systems\nComparison groups: Not explicitly mentioned\nBaseline/control: Not explicitly mentioned\nContext/setting: Scenarios with varying speaker accents\nAssumptions: Not explicitly mentioned\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Speech-to-speech translation systems\nTimeframe: Not explicitly mentioned\nMeasurement method: BLEU scores\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to explore the impact of combining bilateral perturbation and vector quantization on the robustness and accuracy of speech-to-speech translation systems, particularly under conditions of varying speaker accents. Bilateral perturbation is a technique that reduces acoustic multimodality by normalizing style and enhancing information, allowing the model to focus on linguistic content. Vector quantization, on the other hand, discretizes continuous speech representations into finite units, reducing noise and improving clarity. By integrating these two methods, the study hypothesizes that the speech-to-speech translation system will achieve higher BLEU scores, indicating improved translation accuracy and robustness across different speaker accents. This approach addresses gaps in existing research by focusing on the interaction between these techniques and their combined effect on translation performance, which has not been extensively explored. The expected outcome is a more robust translation system capable of maintaining accuracy despite variations in speaker accents, thus enhancing applicability in multilingual and multicultural settings. \nKey Variables:\nBilateral Perturbation: Bilateral perturbation is implemented to address acoustic multimodality by disentangling acoustic information from linguistic representation. It involves style normalization and information enhancement, which help in reducing variability in speech style while preserving linguistic content. This technique is expected to improve translation accuracy by producing more deterministic targets for speech-to-unit translation. The specific implementation will involve applying bilateral perturbation during model training, focusing on reducing variability in rhythm and pitch to enhance translation robustness.\nVector Quantization: Vector quantization (VQ) is used to discretize continuous speech representations into discrete units, simplifying representation and reducing noise. This technique is particularly useful in noise-robust ASR systems, where it helps reduce distortions and improve clarity. In this research, VQ will be implemented in the feature extraction phase, transforming audio signals into discrete units before model input. The expected role of VQ is to enhance the robustness of speech representations, allowing the model to maintain accuracy in noisy environments and across varying speaker accents.\nVarying Speaker Accents: Varying speaker accents will be introduced as a condition to test the robustness of the translation system. This involves using audio data from speakers with different regional or national accents to train and evaluate the system. The implementation will include collecting or synthesizing speech data from diverse accents and incorporating this into the training set. The expected outcome is that the model will learn to generalize better across different speech patterns, improving translation accuracy and robustness in real-world scenarios with accent variations.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using a combination of existing and newly developed codeblocks. Bilateral perturbation will be applied during the model training phase, using style normalization and information enhancement techniques to reduce acoustic variability. This will be achieved by implementing a custom module that applies these transformations to the training data. Vector quantization will be integrated into the feature extraction phase, using a codebook to map continuous speech features to discrete units. This will involve adapting existing vector quantization algorithms to fit the specific requirements of the speech-to-speech translation system. The system will be trained and evaluated on a dataset that includes varying speaker accents, ensuring that the model is exposed to a wide range of speech patterns. The implementation will involve setting up a pipeline where audio data is first processed through the bilateral perturbation module, followed by vector quantization, and finally fed into the translation model. The output will be evaluated using BLEU scores to assess translation accuracy and robustness. This end-to-end implementation will require integrating existing codeblocks for vector quantization and developing new modules for bilateral perturbation and accent variation handling. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be BLEU scores, which measure the accuracy of the translated speech against reference translations. The system will be tested on a benchmark dataset with varying speaker accents, and BLEU scores will be calculated to assess translation accuracy. A control condition will involve a baseline translation system without bilateral perturbation or vector quantization, allowing for comparative analysis. Success will be interpreted as a statistically significant improvement in BLEU scores compared to the baseline, indicating enhanced robustness and accuracy. Secondary metrics may include ASR-BLEU scores to evaluate the semantic preservation of the translated speech and Units-BLEU scores to assess the quality of semantic translation using discrete units.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing speech translation with and without bilateral perturbation and vector quantization, focusing on accent robustness. The experiment should have three modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) defined by a global variable PILOT_MODE.\n\nDataset Requirements:\n1. Use the Huggingface Hub to obtain a multilingual speech dataset with accent variations (e.g., Common Voice or VoxPopuli).\n2.

The hypothesis posits that combining these two dynamic retrieval strategies will enhance the model's ability to retrieve and utilize relevant information, thereby improving the accuracy and completeness of responses. Modular RAG with External Modules allows for flexible and adaptive retrieval strategies by incorporating components such as search, memory, and task adapters, enhancing the model's ability to handle complex queries. Multi-time Retrieval involves iterative knowledge extraction, enabling the model to refine its search process dynamically based on evolving context. This approach addresses the limitations of static retrieval methods, which rely on a fixed corpus and predetermined rules. By leveraging these dynamic retrieval strategies, the model is expected to achieve a higher F1-score, indicating a better balance between precision and recall. This research aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in improving the performance of biomedical question-answering systems, which is crucial for ensuring accurate and reliable information in medical contexts. \nKey Variables:\nModular RAG with External Modules: This variable represents a retrieval-augmented generation framework that incorporates external modules such as search, memory, tuning, and task adapters. These modules enhance the retrieval and generation processes by allowing for more flexible and adaptive strategies. The search module improves retrieval precision, the memory module manages retrieved information for future use, the tuning module optimizes retrieval and generation parameters, and the task adapter tailors the system to specific tasks. This configuration is selected for its ability to handle complex queries and adapt to varying contexts, directly influencing the model's performance in biomedical question-answering tasks.\nMulti-time Retrieval: This variable involves an iterative knowledge extraction process throughout content generation. It allows the language model to conduct retrievals at predetermined intervals or dynamically based on the evolving context. This approach enables iterative refinement of the search process, addressing the limitations of single-time retrieval methods. Multi-time Retrieval is expected to enhance the model's understanding and response quality in intricate inquiries, directly influencing the F1-score by improving both precision and recall in biomedical question-answering tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using a combination of existing and newly developed codeblocks. The Modular RAG framework will be set up with external modules, including a search module for efficient document retrieval, a memory module for managing retrieved information, a tuning module for optimizing retrieval and generation parameters, and a task adapter for tailoring the system to biomedical question-answering tasks. Multi-time Retrieval will be implemented by developing a dynamic retrieval scheduling mechanism that determines the optimal timing for retrieval operations based on the real-time information needs of the language model. This will involve creating a decision-making algorithm to assess when retrieval is necessary and to schedule retrievals accordingly. The implementation will require integrating these components into a cohesive system, ensuring seamless data flow between modules and the language model. The system will be evaluated using biomedical question-answering datasets, with the F1-score as the primary metric to assess performance improvements over static retrieval-augmented models. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is the F1-score, which measures the harmonic mean of precision and recall. This metric is crucial for ensuring that the model maintains a good balance between retrieving all relevant answers (recall) and ensuring that the answers are correct (precision) in biomedical question-answering tasks. The system will be tested on benchmark datasets such as BioASQ, where the model's outputs will be compared against a gold standard of correct answers. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher F1-score compared to static retrieval-augmented models, indicating enhanced accuracy and completeness of responses.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing a baseline static RAG model against an experimental Modular RAG model with Multi-time Retrieval for biomedical question answering. The experiment should be implemented with three possible settings controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable ('MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', 'FULL_EXPERIMENT').\n\nBoth conditions should use gpt-4o-mini as the base model.

The hypothesis posits that this integration will significantly enhance the interpretability and transparency of AI outputs. HITL involves continuous human oversight and intervention, ensuring that ethical guidelines are adhered to throughout the machine learning process. This approach is particularly beneficial in complex ethical contexts, such as healthcare, where nuanced understanding is crucial. Attention Visualization, on the other hand, provides insights into which parts of the input data the model focuses on during decision-making, thereby enhancing transparency. By combining these techniques, the research aims to create a more interpretable and transparent AI system that aligns with ethical standards and improves trust among healthcare professionals. This approach addresses the limitations of current AI systems, which often lack transparency and interpretability, hindering their adoption in clinical settings. The expected outcome is a system where AI-generated outputs are not only accurate but also understandable and ethically aligned, fostering greater acceptance and integration into healthcare workflows. \nKey Variables:\nHuman-in-the-Loop Machine Learning: This approach integrates human oversight into the machine learning process to ensure adherence to ethical guidelines. It involves continuous human supervision and intervention during model training and deployment, particularly useful in contexts requiring nuanced ethical understanding. In this research, HITL will be operationalized by incorporating human annotations and feedback loops into the training of USE embeddings, ensuring that the model aligns with ethical standards throughout its lifecycle. This variable is expected to directly influence the ethical alignment and transparency of AI outputs, making them more interpretable and trustworthy.\nAttention Visualization: Attention Visualization highlights which parts of the input data the model focuses on when making decisions. This is implemented by extracting attention weights from models like transformers and visualizing them to show the distribution of focus across input tokens. In this research, attention visualization will be used to map attention scores to input features, generating heatmaps that illustrate these relationships. This technique is crucial for debugging models and ensuring they are not biased towards irrelevant features. It directly influences the transparency and interpretability of AI outputs, allowing stakeholders to understand and trust the decision-making process.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating HITL and Attention Visualization into the development of USE embeddings. The existing codeblock for Universal Sentence Encoder will be utilized to generate embeddings. Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning will be implemented by creating a feedback loop where human experts annotate data and review model outputs, ensuring ethical alignment. This will require building a new module for human annotation and feedback integration. Attention Visualization will be achieved by using existing visualization tools to extract and display attention weights from the transformer component of USE. This involves adapting visualization interfaces to generate heatmaps that highlight attention patterns. Data will flow from the USE model through the HITL module for ethical oversight and then to the attention visualization interface for transparency. The hypothesis will be realized by iteratively refining the model based on human feedback and visual insights, ensuring that the final AI system is both interpretable and ethically aligned. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the interpretability score, measured by the clarity and comprehensibility of attention visualizations to human experts. Secondary metrics include transparency, assessed by the degree to which model decision-making processes are understandable, and ethical alignment, evaluated through expert reviews of model outputs. The benchmark task involves using healthcare datasets to test the AI system's ability to provide interpretable and transparent outputs. The control condition will be a baseline model using USE embeddings without HITL and Attention Visualization. Improvement will be interpreted as higher interpretability scores and better expert ratings on transparency and ethical alignment, with statistical significance assessed through repeated trials.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing baseline and experimental approaches for healthcare text classification using Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) embeddings. The experiment should have three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nPILOT MODES:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 healthcare text examples from training set, 2 human annotators, 5 evaluation rounds\n- PILOT: Use 100 healthcare text examples from training set, 5 human annotators, 20 evaluation rounds\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset, 20 human annotators, 100 evaluation rounds\n\nDATASET:\n1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Demographic-Specific Sentiment Integration\nShort Description: Integrating demographic-specific rating scales and custom sentiment lexicons into BERT-based toxicity detection models.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating demographic-specific rating scales with custom sentiment lexicons into BERT-based toxicity detection models will improve accuracy and fairness, as measured by F1 score and equalized odds, across diverse demographic groups.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating demographic-specific rating scales with custom sentiment lexicons into BERT-based toxicity detection models\nDependent variable: Accuracy and fairness\nComparison groups: Diverse demographic groups\nBaseline/control: Not explicitly stated\nContext/setting: Across diverse demographic groups\nAssumptions: Demographic-specific rating scales and custom sentiment lexicons can be effectively integrated into BERT-based models\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Diverse demographic groups\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: F1 score and equalized odds\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of demographic-specific rating scales and custom sentiment lexicons into BERT-based toxicity detection models to enhance accuracy and fairness. Demographic-specific rating scales are tailored to capture unique perspectives of different demographic groups, ensuring that the ratings reflect diverse perceptions of toxicity. Custom sentiment lexicons are designed to include domain-specific terms relevant to toxicity detection, capturing nuanced sentiments that generic lexicons might miss. By combining these two approaches, the research aims to improve the model's ability to accurately detect toxic content while ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. The expected outcome is an improvement in the F1 score and equalized odds, indicating better accuracy and reduced bias. This approach addresses gaps in previous studies by focusing on demographic-specific insights and sentiment nuances, providing a more comprehensive understanding of toxicity across different groups. \nKey Variables:\nDemographic-Specific Rating Scales: Demographic-specific rating scales involve customizing the rating mechanism to account for unique perspectives of different demographic groups. This customization ensures that the ratings collected reflect diverse perceptions of toxicity. Implementation requires initial research to determine appropriate scale adjustments for each demographic, followed by testing and validation. This approach aims to reduce bias and improve model accuracy by acknowledging and incorporating demographic diversity in user feedback. The scales will be assessed by comparing the model's performance across different demographic groups, with success indicated by improved accuracy and fairness metrics.\nCustom Sentiment Lexicons: Custom sentiment lexicons are tailored dictionaries used to score text based on specific sentiment attributes. These lexicons include domain-specific terms relevant to toxicity detection, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of sentiment. Implementation involves curating a list of words and phrases with assigned sentiment scores, which are then used to analyze text data. The lexicons will be evaluated by their impact on the model's accuracy and fairness, with success indicated by improved detection of toxic language and reduced bias across demographic groups.\nBERT-based Classifiers: BERT-based classifiers utilize the transformer architecture to capture contextual relationships in text. These models are pre-trained on large corpora and fine-tuned on toxicity detection datasets. The implementation involves setting hyperparameters and evaluating the model's performance across demographic groups. The BERT-based classifiers serve as the foundation for integrating demographic-specific rating scales and custom sentiment lexicons, with success measured by improvements in F1 score and equalized odds.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging existing codeblocks for BERT-based classifiers and sentiment analysis. The implementation begins with the development of demographic-specific rating scales, which involves customizing the rating mechanism for different demographic groups. This customization will be informed by existing demographic data and validated through testing. Next, custom sentiment lexicons will be developed by curating domain-specific terms and assigning sentiment scores. These lexicons will be integrated into the sentiment analysis codeblock, enhancing the model's ability to detect nuanced sentiments. The BERT-based classifier will be fine-tuned on a dataset that includes both the demographic-specific ratings and sentiment scores. The integration will be facilitated by a glue module that combines the outputs of the rating scales and sentiment lexicons, feeding them into the BERT-based model. The system will be evaluated using F1 score and equalized odds, with the expectation that the integration will lead to improved accuracy and fairness across diverse demographic groups. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are the F1 score and equalized odds. The F1 score provides a balance between precision and recall, measuring the model's ability to accurately detect toxic content. Equalized odds assess the fairness of the model by comparing true positive and false positive rates across demographic groups. The hypothesis will be tested using a benchmark toxicity detection dataset, with a control condition using a standard BERT-based classifier without the integration of demographic-specific rating scales and custom sentiment lexicons. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher F1 score and more balanced equalized odds compared to the control condition. Statistical confidence will be assessed through multiple runs and significance testing.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether integrating demographic-specific rating scales and custom sentiment lexicons into BERT-based toxicity detection models improves accuracy and fairness. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot phases (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable.\n\nData Generation and Preparation:\n1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Zero-Shot Discriminator Hybrid\nShort Description: Combining zero-shot prompting with a binary classifier discriminator to enhance reasoning in sub-10B models.\nHypothesis to explore: A hybrid model using zero-shot prompting for rationale-based distillation and a binary classifier discriminator will improve reasoning step accuracy and overall task performance in sub-10B parameter models on arithmetic reasoning tasks compared to models using only zero-shot prompting or a binary classifier discriminator alone.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Hybrid model using zero-shot prompting for rationale-based distillation and a binary classifier discriminator\nDependent variable: Reasoning step accuracy and overall task performance\nComparison groups: Hybrid model vs. models using only zero-shot prompting or a binary classifier discriminator alone\nBaseline/control: Models using only zero-shot prompting or a binary classifier discriminator alone\nContext/setting: Sub-10B parameter models on arithmetic reasoning tasks\nAssumptions: The hybrid model can be effectively implemented in sub-10B parameter models\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Sub-10B parameter models\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Comparison of reasoning step accuracy and overall task performance\n\nLong Description: Description: This research investigates the potential of combining zero-shot prompting for rationale-based distillation with a binary classifier discriminator to enhance reasoning step accuracy and overall task performance in sub-10B parameter models, specifically focusing on arithmetic reasoning tasks. Zero-shot prompting leverages the pre-trained knowledge of large models like GPT-3 to generate rationales without task-specific fine-tuning, reducing data requirements. The binary classifier discriminator evaluates each reasoning step's correctness, providing feedback to refine the model's reasoning strategy. By integrating these techniques, the study aims to capitalize on the strengths of both approaches: the efficiency and data reduction of zero-shot prompting and the precision improvement from discriminator-guided feedback. This combination is expected to yield a model that not only performs better on reasoning tasks but also remains computationally efficient, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The hypothesis will be tested using benchmark datasets like GSM8K, with performance measured by reasoning step accuracy and overall task success rates. \nKey Variables:\nZero-shot Prompting: Zero-shot prompting involves using a pre-trained model like GPT-3 to generate rationales without additional fine-tuning on task-specific data. This method reduces data requirements by leveraging the model's existing knowledge base, making it particularly useful in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. In this research, zero-shot prompting will be used to generate rationales for arithmetic reasoning tasks, providing a basis for training smaller models. The expected role of zero-shot prompting is to provide high-quality rationales that guide the smaller model's reasoning process, enhancing its performance without the need for extensive data.\nBinary Classifier Discriminator: A binary classifier discriminator evaluates whether each reasoning step is correct or incorrect. This involves training a binary classifier on a dataset of reasoning steps labeled as correct or incorrect. The discriminator provides feedback on the correctness of reasoning paths, allowing the main model to adjust its strategy accordingly. In this research, the binary classifier will be used to guide the reasoning process of the sub-10B parameter model, aiming to improve reasoning step accuracy by ensuring that only correct steps are reinforced. The performance of the discriminator will be evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.\nSub-10B Parameter Models: Sub-10B parameter models are smaller language models that balance reasoning abilities and computational efficiency. These models are used in distillation processes to adopt reasoning skills from larger models while maintaining a manageable size. In this research, sub-10B parameter models will be the primary focus, as they are trained using zero-shot prompting and guided by a binary classifier discriminator. The goal is to enhance their reasoning capabilities without increasing computational demands, making them suitable for deployment in environments with limited resources.\n\nImplementation: The implementation of this hypothesis will involve several key steps using the capabilities of CodeScientist. First, the zero-shot prompting technique will be employed to generate rationales using a pre-trained GPT-3 model. This will be done by crafting prompts that guide the model to produce reasoning paths for arithmetic tasks in the GSM8K dataset. These rationales will serve as the training data for sub-10B parameter models. Next, a binary classifier discriminator will be developed to evaluate the correctness of each reasoning step. The classifier will be trained on a labeled dataset of reasoning steps, distinguishing between correct and incorrect steps. The integration of these components will be facilitated by creating a pipeline where the zero-shot generated rationales are fed into the sub-10B model, and the discriminator provides feedback on each step. Existing codeblocks for model loading, prompting, and evaluation will be utilized, while new modules for the discriminator and data integration will be built. The final setup will involve running the model on the GSM8K dataset, measuring reasoning step accuracy and overall task performance, and comparing results against baseline models using only one of the techniques. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be reasoning step accuracy and overall task performance. Reasoning step accuracy will be measured using precision, recall, and F1-score, focusing on the correctness of each reasoning step as evaluated by the binary classifier discriminator. Overall task performance will be assessed using success rates on the GSM8K dataset, comparing the hybrid model's results against baseline models using only zero-shot prompting or a binary classifier discriminator. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in both reasoning step accuracy and task success rates, with multiple runs conducted to ensure robustness. The results will be analyzed using standard statistical methods to confirm the effectiveness of the hybrid approach.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing three approaches to arithmetic reasoning: (1) zero-shot prompting baseline, (2) binary classifier discriminator baseline, and (3) a hybrid approach combining both.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Dynamic Prompt Transfer\nShort Description: Exploring dynamic prompt length and pre-trained initialization to enhance soft prompt transferability in PLMs.\nHypothesis to explore: Dynamic prompt length combined with pre-trained prompt initialization significantly enhances the transferability of soft prompts in pre-trained language models, as indicated by increased feed-forward layer activation overlap.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Dynamic prompt length combined with pre-trained prompt initialization\nDependent variable: Transferability of soft prompts\nComparison groups: Not explicitly mentioned\nBaseline/control: Not explicitly mentioned\nContext/setting: Pre-trained language models\nAssumptions: Increased feed-forward layer activation overlap indicates enhanced transferability\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not explicitly mentioned\nTimeframe: Not explicitly mentioned\nMeasurement method: Increased feed-forward layer activation overlap\n\nLong Description: Description: This research investigates the impact of using dynamic prompt length and pre-trained prompt initialization on the transferability of soft prompts in pre-trained language models (PLMs). The hypothesis posits that dynamically adjusting the prompt length based on task complexity, combined with initializing prompts using pre-trained prompts from similar tasks, will enhance the transferability of soft prompts. This is measured by the overlap of activated neurons in the feed-forward layers of PLMs. Dynamic prompt length allows for flexible adaptation to varying task requirements, optimizing both performance and computational efficiency. Pre-trained prompt initialization leverages existing knowledge from related tasks, providing a strong starting point that accelerates convergence and improves performance. The expected outcome is a higher overlap of activated neurons, indicating better transferability. This approach addresses gaps in the literature by exploring the combined effect of these two techniques, which have not been extensively tested together. The research aims to provide insights into optimizing prompt transferability, contributing to more efficient use of PLMs in diverse tasks. \nKey Variables:\nDynamic Prompt Length: Dynamic prompt length involves adjusting the number of tokens or embeddings in the prompt based on task complexity or model performance. This is implemented by monitoring task performance metrics such as accuracy or F1 score and dynamically adjusting the prompt length during training. This approach allows for flexible adaptation to varying task requirements, optimizing both performance and computational efficiency. It is particularly useful in environments with diverse tasks or limited computational resources, allowing for efficient resource allocation based on task demands. The expected role of dynamic prompt length is to provide the right amount of task-specific information without unnecessary computational overhead, directly influencing the model's ability to adapt to new tasks.\nPre-trained Prompt Initialization: Pre-trained prompt initialization uses prompts trained on source tasks as the starting point for target tasks. This method leverages the knowledge embedded in pre-trained prompts to provide a strong initialization, accelerating convergence and improving performance. Implementation involves selecting relevant pre-trained prompts and adapting them to the target task. This strategy is beneficial in scenarios with limited training data, as it allows effective knowledge transfer from source tasks. The expected role of pre-trained prompt initialization is to enhance the model's starting point, reducing the number of training iterations needed and improving the model's ability to generalize to new tasks.\nFeed-forward Layer Activation Overlap: Feed-forward layer activation overlap measures the transferability of soft prompts by analyzing the activation patterns in the feed-forward layers of PLMs. It involves tracking which neurons are activated by the prompt and comparing this set to the neurons activated by the target task. The overlap percentage is calculated by dividing the number of common activated neurons by the total number of neurons activated by either the prompt or the task. This metric emphasizes the role of model stimulation in determining prompt transferability, with higher overlap indicating better transferability. It is particularly relevant for models like T5 and RoBERTa, where neuron activation patterns can be complex due to model size and architecture.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities, leveraging existing codeblocks for model interaction and prompt management. The dynamic prompt length will be implemented by creating a feedback loop that adjusts the prompt length based on task performance metrics. This will involve monitoring the model's accuracy and F1 score and using these metrics to dynamically adjust the number of tokens in the prompt. Pre-trained prompt initialization will be achieved by selecting prompts from a library of pre-trained prompts, which will be integrated into the model's architecture as initial weights. The feed-forward layer activation overlap will be measured by tracking neuron activations in the feed-forward layers of the PLM when the prompt is applied. This will involve using existing codeblocks for neuron activation tracking and overlap calculation. Data will flow between components through a centralized data manager that coordinates prompt adjustments, initialization, and activation tracking. New logic will be built to integrate dynamic prompt length adjustments with pre-trained prompt initialization, ensuring seamless interaction between these components. The hypothesis will be realized end-to-end in code by orchestrating these components to evaluate the impact of the combined techniques on prompt transferability. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is the feed-forward layer activation overlap, which measures the transferability of soft prompts. This will be calculated by comparing the activation patterns of neurons in the feed-forward layers when different prompts are applied. The control condition will be a baseline model using static prompt length and random initialization. The secondary metrics include task accuracy and F1 score, which will provide additional insights into the model's performance. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher overlap percentage and improved task performance metrics compared to the baseline. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with results analyzed to determine the significance of the observed improvements.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment to test whether dynamic prompt length combined with pre-trained initialization enhances soft prompt transferability in PLMs. The experiment should have the following components:\n\n1. MODEL CONFIGURATION:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini as the base model\n- Implement three conditions:\n  a) Baseline: Static prompt length (64 tokens) with random initialization\n  b) Dynamic Only: Dynamic prompt length (32-128 tokens) with random initialization\n  c) Combined: Dynamic prompt length (32-128 tokens) with pre-trained initialization\n\n2.

The Chain of Knowledge framework utilizes a hierarchical approach to ground language models with structured knowledge bases, chaining multiple sources to provide context and enhance understanding. By integrating this framework with GPT models, which are known for their proficiency in generating coherent text across multiple languages, we hypothesize that the models will exhibit reduced hallucination rates and improved factual accuracy. This integration is expected to address the limitations of current models that often produce hallucinated content due to a lack of grounding. The study will involve implementing the Chain of Knowledge framework within the GPT architecture and evaluating its performance using the Poly-FEVER benchmark, which provides a comprehensive assessment of factual accuracy across languages. The expected outcome is a demonstrable improvement in the model's ability to generate factually accurate content, thereby enhancing user satisfaction and trust in multilingual applications. \nKey Variables:\nChain of Knowledge Framework: The Chain of Knowledge framework is a hierarchical grounding approach that chains multiple structured knowledge sources to provide context and enhance understanding in language models. In this experiment, it will be integrated into the GPT family models to ground their outputs in structured knowledge, thereby reducing hallucination rates. This framework was selected due to its ability to improve factual accuracy by ensuring that generated content aligns with verified knowledge. The expected role of this framework is to provide a reliable grounding mechanism that reduces the risk of generating inaccurate or hallucinated information. The effectiveness of this integration will be assessed using the Poly-FEVER benchmark, which measures factual accuracy across multiple languages.\nGPT Family Models: The GPT family models are transformer-based language models known for their proficiency in generating coherent and contextually relevant text across various domains. In this research, these models will be used as the base architecture for integrating the Chain of Knowledge framework. The choice of GPT models is due to their established performance in multilingual settings and their ability to handle diverse languages, including English, Spanish, and Chinese. The integration aims to enhance the factual accuracy and reduce hallucination rates by grounding the models' outputs in structured knowledge. The performance will be evaluated using the Poly-FEVER benchmark, focusing on improvements in factual accuracy and reduction in hallucination rates.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by integrating the Chain of Knowledge framework with the GPT family models. The implementation will involve modifying the GPT architecture to incorporate a hierarchical grounding mechanism that chains multiple structured knowledge sources. This will be achieved by embedding the Chain of Knowledge framework within the existing GPT model architecture, allowing it to access and utilize structured knowledge bases during text generation. The integration will be tested using the Poly-FEVER benchmark, which provides a comprehensive evaluation of factual accuracy across languages. The experiment will involve setting up a pipeline that retrieves relevant knowledge from structured sources, processes it, and integrates it into the model's response generation process. The performance will be compared against a baseline GPT model without grounding, focusing on metrics such as hallucination rates and factual accuracy. The expected outcome is a significant reduction in hallucination rates and an improvement in factual accuracy across English, Spanish, and Chinese. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be hallucination rates and factual accuracy, as measured by the Poly-FEVER benchmark. The Poly-FEVER benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of factual accuracy across multiple languages, making it an ideal tool for evaluating the impact of the Chain of Knowledge framework on GPT models. The control condition will be a baseline GPT model without grounding, allowing for a direct comparison of performance. Success will be interpreted as a significant reduction in hallucination rates and an improvement in factual accuracy compared to the baseline. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with improvements interpreted as a reduction in hallucination rates and higher factual accuracy scores.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to test whether integrating a Chain of Knowledge framework with GPT models reduces hallucination rates and improves factual accuracy in a multilingual context. The experiment should be implemented with three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), with the following specifications:\n\nPILOT MODES:\n- MINI_PILOT: Test with 10 factual statements (4 English, 3 Spanish, 3 Chinese), focusing on common concepts that exist in ConceptNet.\n- PILOT: Test with 100 factual statements (40 English, 30 Spanish, 30 Chinese).\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Test with 1000 factual statements (400 English, 300 Spanish, 300 Chinese).\n\nBASELINE SYSTEM:\n1.

Ensure proper error handling and logging throughout\n\nOUTPUT:\n1. Generate a results.json file with all metrics\n2. Generate a detailed log file with all system operations\n3. Include bootstrap resampling results for statistical significance\n\nThe experiment should be deterministic (use fixed random seeds) and reproducible. All intermediate results should be cached to avoid unnecessary API calls during development. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Factual Consistency Enhancement\nShort Description: Enhancing conversational AI factual consistency using Factual Ablation and Edge Computing.\nHypothesis to explore: Implementing Factual Ablation alongside Edge Computing will enhance the Factual Consistency of conversational AI systems, as measured by Factual Consistency Evaluation, in dynamic simulated environments.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Implementing Factual Ablation alongside Edge Computing\nDependent variable: Factual Consistency of conversational AI systems\nComparison groups: Not explicitly mentioned\nBaseline/control: Not explicitly mentioned\nContext/setting: Dynamic simulated environments\nAssumptions: Not explicitly mentioned\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Conversational AI systems\nTimeframe: Not explicitly mentioned\nMeasurement method: Factual Consistency Evaluation\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of Factual Ablation and Edge Computing to improve the Factual Consistency of conversational AI systems. Factual Ablation involves presenting AI models with pairs of grounding documents and assessing their preference for more factually relevant content. This technique is expected to guide models towards generating responses that are more aligned with factual information. Edge Computing, on the other hand, processes data closer to the data source, reducing latency and enhancing real-time response capabilities. By combining these two techniques, the research aims to address the challenge of maintaining factual consistency in dynamic environments where conditions change unpredictably. The hypothesis posits that this integration will lead to improved Factual Consistency Evaluation scores, indicating a higher alignment of AI-generated responses with verified knowledge sources. This research is significant as it explores a novel combination of techniques that have not been extensively tested together, offering potential improvements in the reliability and adaptability of conversational AI systems. \nKey Variables:\nFactual Ablation: Factual Ablation is a technique used to measure factual consistency by presenting AI models with pairs of grounding documents and evaluating their preference for the more factually relevant one. This method helps in identifying and enhancing the model's ability to adhere to factual information. The evaluation set for factual ablation is constructed by collecting grounding pairs from Wikipedia data, which undergo continuous edits, providing a rich source of document pairs for testing. This method not only aids in measuring factual consistency but also guides the training process to improve the model's adherence to factual grounding.\nEdge Computing: Edge Computing involves processing data at the edge of the network, closer to the data source, rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. This reduces the latency associated with data transmission over long distances. In practice, edge devices such as IoT gateways or local servers are used to perform initial data processing and analysis, with only essential data being sent to the cloud for further processing. This approach not only decreases latency but also reduces bandwidth usage and enhances data privacy, making it an effective strategy for deploying conversational AI systems in real-time applications.\nFactual Consistency Evaluation: Factual Consistency Evaluation focuses on ensuring that AI-generated responses are consistent with grounding knowledge. This involves using techniques like K-DIAL and RLFC to enhance factual knowledge expressions in dialogue systems. The evaluation employs a binary NLI model as a factual consistency classifier, trained on publicly available benchmarks for factual consistency evaluations. The consistency score obtained from the reward model is used for RLFC training to induce factual expressions within feed-forward networks (FFNs). This approach aims to improve the ability of dialogue systems to express factual knowledge accurately, thereby enhancing the factual consistency of AI-generated responses.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, leveraging its capabilities to automate the experimental process. The implementation will involve setting up a conversational AI system with Factual Ablation and Edge Computing components. The Factual Ablation technique will be integrated by constructing an evaluation set with grounding document pairs from Wikipedia data. This will guide the AI model to prefer more factually relevant documents during response generation. Edge Computing will be implemented by deploying the AI system on edge devices, ensuring low-latency data processing and real-time response capabilities. The Factual Consistency Evaluation will be conducted using a binary NLI model as a factual consistency classifier, trained on publicly available benchmarks. The evaluation will measure the consistency of AI-generated responses with grounding knowledge, providing a quantitative assessment of the hypothesis. The entire process will be automated using CodeScientist's Experiment Builder, which will create, run, and debug the experiment code in a container, ensuring a streamlined and efficient research workflow. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the Factual Consistency Evaluation score, which measures the alignment of AI-generated responses with verified knowledge sources. This score will be obtained using a binary NLI model as a factual consistency classifier, trained on publicly available benchmarks. The evaluation will involve comparing the AI's responses to a set of ground truth answers or expected outcomes, providing a quantitative measure of factual consistency. Success will be interpreted as a significant improvement in the Factual Consistency Evaluation score compared to a baseline system without the integration of Factual Ablation and Edge Computing. The evaluation will be conducted over multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether Factual Ablation alongside Edge Computing enhances factual consistency in conversational AI systems. The experiment should be implemented as follows:\n\nGLOBAL SETTINGS:\n- Create a global variable PILOT_MODE that can be set to 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'\n- For MINI_PILOT: Use 10 Wikipedia articles, 5 questions per article, 2 runs\n- For PILOT: Use 50 Wikipedia articles, 10 questions per article, 5 runs\n- For FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use 500 Wikipedia articles, 20 questions per article, 10 runs\n\nDATA PREPARATION:\n1.

For each article:\n   - Create a simplified version by removing some factual details (this will be the 'less factual' version)\n   - Generate questions about the article using gpt-4o-mini\n   - Store the article pairs (original/simplified) and questions\n\nBASELINE SYSTEM:\n1. Implement a basic QA system using gpt-4o-mini that:\n   - Takes a question and both article versions as input\n   - Has a 500ms artificial delay (simulating non-edge compute)\n   - Generates an answer\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM:\n1. Implement the same QA system but with:\n   - Factual Ablation: First determine which article version is more factually relevant\n   - Edge Computing simulation: Only 50ms artificial delay\n   - Generate answer using only the selected article\n\nEVALUATION:\n1. For each question:\n   - Get answers from both baseline and experimental systems\n   - Use gpt-4o-mini to score factual consistency (0-1) by comparing answers to original articles\n2. Compare systems using bootstrap resampling to determine statistical significance\n\nOUTPUT:\n1. Generate a results file containing:\n   - Average factual consistency scores for both systems\n   - Statistical significance test results\n   - Time taken per question for both systems\n   - Example outputs showing article pairs, questions, and answers\n\nPILOT PROCESS:\n1. First run MINI_PILOT\n2. If successful, run PILOT\n3. Stop after PILOT (do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n\nLOGGING:\n- Log all major steps, including:\n  * Data loading and preparation\n  * Question generation\n  * Answer generation\n  * Evaluation scores\n  * Error cases\n  * Time taken for each major component\n\nERROR HANDLING:\n- Implement appropriate error handling for:\n  * API failures\n  * Invalid outputs\n  * Timeout cases\n  * Resource exhaustion\n\nPlease implement this experiment using the specified codeblocks, ensuring proper error handling and logging throughout. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

Fourier-Mixed Window Attention reduces the complexity of full attention mechanisms by computing attention within non-overlapping windows and shifting these windows to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. Dynamic Global Filters adaptively extract multi-dimensional frequency domain features, preserving information from the source data and enhancing robustness. By combining these techniques, the model is expected to achieve faster training times and improved resistance to adversarial inputs, while maintaining accuracy. This approach addresses the computational inefficiencies and robustness challenges of traditional Transformer models, offering a novel solution not extensively explored in existing literature. \nKey Variables:\nFourier-Mixed Window Attention: This variable involves using Fourier Transforms as a mixing tool to reduce the complexity of full attention mechanisms. It applies attention within non-overlapping windows and shifts these windows to efficiently capture both local and global dependencies. This method is particularly effective for tasks involving long sequences, where traditional attention mechanisms become computationally expensive. The expected outcome is a significant reduction in computational complexity, leading to faster processing times.\nDynamic Global Filters: Dynamic Global Filters are designed to work with Fourier Transform-based models to narrow the gap between Fourier Transform-based global filters and multi-head self-attention mechanisms. This approach involves adaptively extracting multi-dimensional frequency domain features and mapping them as linear combinations of these features. The dynamic filtering process allows the model to better preserve information from the source data, reducing information loss and potentially enhancing interpretability and robustness. This method is particularly useful in tasks where maintaining the integrity of the original data is crucial, such as in image reconstruction and generation.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the Fourier-Mixed Window Attention and Dynamic Global Filters within a Transformer model. The Fourier-Mixed Window Attention will be applied to reduce the complexity of full attention mechanisms by computing attention within non-overlapping windows and shifting these windows to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. Dynamic Global Filters will be integrated to adaptively extract multi-dimensional frequency domain features, preserving information from the source data and enhancing robustness. The implementation will involve modifying the Transformer architecture to include these components, with data flowing from the input layer through the Fourier-Mixed Window Attention and Dynamic Global Filters, before reaching the output layer. The model will be trained and evaluated on sentiment analysis tasks using standard datasets, with metrics such as training time, adversarial resistance, and accuracy being recorded. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be computational efficiency, measured by reduced training time, and robustness, assessed through adversarial resistance tests. Secondary metrics will include accuracy in sentiment analysis tasks, evaluated using standard datasets. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant reduction in training time and enhanced adversarial resistance, while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to baseline Transformer models. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with qualitative assessments derived from robustness tests.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment comparing a baseline Transformer model against a Fourier-Enhanced Robust Transformer (FERT) model for sentiment analysis. The experiment should follow these specifications:\n\n1.

Multi-Agent Debate involves multiple LLMs assuming different roles to engage in a debate, providing diverse perspectives and reasoning processes. This approach is expected to mitigate biases by incorporating varied viewpoints and ensuring a balanced evaluation. Meanwhile, Multi-Source Data Curation involves gathering instructional data from a wide array of sources, ensuring a broad representation of topics, perspectives, and contexts. This method aims to improve the generalization capabilities of LLMs and reduce bias in outputs. The hypothesis posits that the integration of these two techniques will lead to a more substantial reduction in political bias compared to traditional single-agent evaluations with less diverse data. The expected outcome is that the LLMs will generate outputs that are more neutral and less biased, enhancing the fairness and reliability of the model's performance. \nKey Variables:\nMulti-Agent Debate: Multi-Agent Debate involves using multiple LLMs that assume different roles or perspectives to engage in a debate, refining evaluation results by incorporating diverse viewpoints. This technique is implemented by setting up a framework where each agent presents arguments based on its assigned role, and the final decision is made by aggregating insights from all agents. This method enhances the reliability of evaluations by ensuring that different aspects of the task are considered, leading to more balanced and comprehensive assessments. The expected role of this variable is to mitigate biases that might arise from single-model evaluations by incorporating diverse viewpoints and reasoning processes.\nMulti-Source Data Curation: Multi-Source Data Curation involves gathering instructional data from a wide array of sources to ensure a broad representation of topics, perspectives, and contexts. This approach includes selecting datasets from different domains such as news articles, scientific papers, social media, and literature to cover diverse viewpoints. The goal is to balance the representation of different topics by ensuring that no single source dominates the dataset. This method helps in creating models that are more aligned with real-world diversity, thereby reducing the likelihood of biased AI systems. The expected role of this variable is to improve the generalization capabilities of LLMs and reduce bias in outputs by providing a more comprehensive and balanced training dataset.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to design and execute experiments. The Multi-Agent Debate will be set up by configuring multiple LLMs to assume different roles and engage in a debate over the outputs generated by a primary LLM. Each agent will present arguments based on its assigned role, and the final decision will be made by aggregating insights from all agents. This will require building a debate framework that allows for the integration of outputs from different agents. For Multi-Source Data Curation, a diverse dataset will be curated from multiple sources, including news articles, scientific papers, social media, and literature. This dataset will be used to train the LLMs, ensuring a broad representation of topics and perspectives. The implementation will involve setting up data pipelines to collect and preprocess data from various sources, ensuring that the dataset is balanced and representative. The hypothesis will be realized by running experiments to compare the outputs generated by the LLMs using the Multi-Agent Debate and Multi-Source Data Curation against a baseline of single-agent evaluations with less diverse data. The results will be analyzed to assess the reduction in political bias and the improvement in output neutrality. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the reduction in political bias, measured using a bias detection algorithm that assesses the neutrality of the LLM outputs. This will involve comparing the outputs generated by the Multi-Agent Debate with Multi-Source Data Curation against a baseline of single-agent evaluations with less diverse data. The secondary metric will be the improvement in output neutrality, assessed using a Likert Scale Scoring method where outputs are rated on a scale based on their neutrality and fairness. The hypothesis will be tested by running multiple experiments and analyzing the results to determine the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing political bias. Success will be interpreted as a significant reduction in bias scores and an improvement in neutrality ratings compared to the baseline.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether Multi-Agent Debate with Multi-Source Data Curation reduces political bias in LLM outputs compared to single-agent evaluation. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable.\n\nData Generation:\n1. First, generate a set of politically-charged questions/topics that require responses. For MINI_PILOT use 5 questions, for PILOT use 25 questions, for FULL_EXPERIMENT use 100 questions. Questions should cover topics like immigration, gun control, climate change, healthcare, etc. Use the Data Generation with LLM codeblock to generate these, with specific instructions to generate politically contentious topics that reasonable people might disagree about.\n\nBaseline Condition:\n1. Implement a single-agent evaluator that uses gpt-4o-mini to generate responses to each political question\n2. The agent should be given minimal context -- just the question and a request to answer it\n\nExperimental Condition:\n1. Implement a multi-agent debate system with 3 agents (also using gpt-4o-mini):\n   - Agent 1: Conservative perspective\n   - Agent 2: Liberal perspective\n   - Agent 3: Neutral moderator\n2. For each question:\n   - Have Agent 1 and 2 each generate an initial response\n   - Have them critique each other's responses\n   - Have the moderator synthesize a final, balanced response\n\nData Curation:\n1. For the baseline, use a single source of background information (e.g., Wikipedia)\n2. For the experimental condition, use multiple sources including:\n   - Wikipedia\n   - Academic papers (via Huggingface datasets)\n   - News articles from different political leanings\n   - Government/NGO reports\n\nEvaluation:\n1. For each response (both baseline and experimental):\n   - Have 3 independent LLM evaluators (using gpt-4o-mini) rate the political bias on a 1-5 Likert scale\n   - Have them provide specific justification for their ratings\n   - Average the ratings to get a final bias score\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Compare bias scores between baseline and experimental conditions using bootstrap resampling\n2. Generate summary statistics including:\n   - Mean bias scores for each condition\n   - Standard deviations\n   - Effect size\n   - Statistical significance\n3. Create line plots showing bias scores across questions for both conditions\n\nPilot Modes:\nMINI_PILOT:\n- 5 questions\n- 1 round of debate\n- Quick bias evaluation\n- Training set only\n- Runtime target: 5-10 minutes\n\nPILOT:\n- 25 questions\n- 2 rounds of debate\n- Full bias evaluation\n- Training (20 questions) and dev (5 questions) sets\n- Runtime target: 30-60 minutes\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n- 100 questions\n- 3 rounds of debate\n- Comprehensive evaluation\n- Proper train/dev/test split\n- Runtime target: Several hours\n\nThe experiment should run MINI_PILOT first, then if successful, run PILOT. Stop after PILOT - do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT without human verification of pilot results.\n\nLogging:\n- Log all LLM interactions\n- Log all bias scores and justifications\n- Log timing information\n- Log any errors or unexpected behaviors\n\nOutput:\n1. CSV file with all raw data\n2. PDF with bias score plots\n3. JSON with summary statistics\n4. Full log file of all system interactions\n5. README describing how to interpret results \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1. A report, describing the results of your research. The report should include, among other things, the following parts: Title, Abstract, Introduction, Approach, Experiments, Results, Conclusion, References.\n 2.

Dependency Graph Restructuring modifies the syntactic structure of input data using dependency graphs, emphasizing syntactic relationships and enabling models to decompose and understand complex queries more effectively. Semantic Role Labeling, on the other hand, identifies predicate-argument structures, clarifying roles and relationships within sentences, thus enhancing the semantic understanding of queries. By combining these techniques, the research aims to improve the model's ability to perform compositional reasoning, thereby reducing the compositionality gap ratio, which measures the model's performance difference between single-hop and multi-hop tasks. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods that often fail to generalize over complex inputs by providing a structured and semantically enriched input representation. The expected outcome is a more robust language model capable of handling intricate multi-hop queries with improved accuracy and reduced errors. \nKey Variables:\nDependency Graph Restructuring: Dependency Graph Restructuring involves transforming input sentences into graph representations that highlight syntactic dependencies between words. This technique uses dependency parsing algorithms to create a graph structure, emphasizing syntactic relationships crucial for understanding complex queries. By restructuring input data in this manner, the model can better decompose and interpret multi-hop questions, aiding in the reduction of the compositionality gap. This variable was selected for its ability to enhance syntactic understanding, which is often lost in flat input embeddings. The expected role of this variable is to improve the model's syntactic comprehension, directly influencing its ability to perform compositional reasoning.\nSemantic Role Labeling: Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) identifies and labels the predicate-argument structures within sentences, clarifying the roles and relationships of entities. Implemented using tools like AllenNLP, SRL enhances the semantic understanding of input data by labeling roles such as 'agent', 'patient', or 'instrument'. This process aids language models in grasping the context and meaning of queries, crucial for reducing the compositionality gap. SRL was chosen for its ability to provide a semantic layer of understanding, complementing the syntactic insights from Dependency Graph Restructuring. Its role is to improve the model's semantic comprehension, enabling it to handle complex language tasks more effectively.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating Dependency Graph Restructuring and Semantic Role Labeling into the language model's preprocessing pipeline. First, dependency parsing algorithms, such as those from spaCy or the Stanford Parser, will be employed to transform input sentences into dependency graphs, highlighting syntactic relationships. This restructuring will be followed by Semantic Role Labeling using pre-trained models from AllenNLP to identify and label predicate-argument structures within the input data. The integration will involve creating a preprocessing module that combines these two techniques, ensuring that both syntactic and semantic information is preserved and highlighted in the input representation. The language model will then process this enriched input to perform multi-hop question answering tasks. The expected data flow involves initial text input being parsed into a dependency graph, followed by SRL processing, resulting in a semantically and syntactically enriched input that is fed into the language model. This approach leverages existing codeblocks for dependency parsing and SRL while building new integration logic to combine their outputs effectively. The end-to-end implementation will involve setting up the parsing and labeling tools, configuring the language model to accept the enriched input, and evaluating the model's performance on benchmark multi-hop question answering datasets. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is the compositionality gap ratio, which measures the difference in performance between single-hop and multi-hop question answering tasks. This ratio will be calculated by assessing the model's ability to correctly answer multi-hop questions that require composing multiple facts, compared to its performance on single-hop questions. Secondary metrics include task accuracy and F1-score, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's reasoning capabilities. The benchmark dataset for evaluation will be the Compositional Freebase Questions (CFQ) dataset, known for its challenging compositional generalization tasks. Success will be interpreted as a significant reduction in the compositionality gap ratio, indicating improved compositional reasoning, alongside higher accuracy and F1-scores compared to baseline models without the integrated preprocessing techniques.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment to evaluate whether integrating Dependency Graph Restructuring with Semantic Role Labeling reduces the compositionality gap in multi-hop QA. The experiment should have the following components:\n\nGLOBAL PARAMETERS:\n- PILOT_MODE (str): Set to one of ['MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', 'FULL_EXPERIMENT']\n- For MINI_PILOT: Use 10 single-hop and 10 multi-hop questions from CFQ training set\n- For PILOT: Use 100 single-hop and 100 multi-hop questions from CFQ training set, and 50 each from validation set\n- For FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full CFQ dataset splits as provided\n\nDATASET:\n1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: P-Tuning for Text Completion\nShort Description: Investigating P-Tuning's impact on GPT-2's text completion performance using BLEU scores.\nHypothesis to explore: P-Tuning with GPT-2 will result in improved BLEU scores for text completion tasks compared to using soft prompts.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: P-Tuning with GPT-2\nDependent variable: BLEU scores for text completion tasks\nComparison groups: P-Tuning with GPT-2 vs. using soft prompts\nBaseline/control: using soft prompts\nContext/setting: text completion tasks\nAssumptions: BLEU scores are a valid measure of performance improvement\nRelationship type: causation\nPopulation: not specified\nTimeframe: not specified\nMeasurement method: BLEU scores\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to explore the effectiveness of P-Tuning with GPT-2 in enhancing the performance of text completion tasks, specifically measured by BLEU scores. P-Tuning involves the use of trainable continuous prompt embeddings combined with discrete prompts, allowing for a flexible optimization of prompts in a continuous space. This approach is hypothesized to provide a more nuanced guidance to the model compared to soft prompts, which only introduce continuous vectors into the embedding space. By leveraging the unique capabilities of P-Tuning, this study seeks to determine whether it can outperform soft prompts in generating coherent and contextually relevant text completions. The motivation for this research stems from the need to improve language model outputs in tasks where the quality of text generation is critical. The expected outcome is that P-Tuning will yield higher BLEU scores, indicating better alignment with reference texts, thus demonstrating its potential as a superior prompting technique for text completion tasks. \nKey Variables:\nPrompt Type: P-Tuning is selected for its ability to optimize prompts in a continuous space, providing flexibility and efficiency in guiding model responses. It combines continuous embeddings with discrete prompts, converting discrete optimization problems into continuous ones that can be handled through gradient descent. This method is particularly effective in scenarios requiring minimal parameter changes, making it a valuable alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods. The expected role of P-Tuning in this research is to enhance the model's ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant text completions, directly influencing the BLEU score as a metric of success.\nModel Type: GPT-2 is chosen for its transformer-based architecture optimized for text generation tasks. It utilizes a decoder-only architecture and is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. In this research, GPT-2 will be conditioned with P-Tuning to generate text completions, with the expectation that the model's performance will improve in terms of BLEU scores when compared to soft prompts.\nTask Type: Text completion tasks involve generating the continuation of a given text input. This task is selected for its relevance in evaluating the coherence and contextual relevance of generated text. The effectiveness of P-Tuning will be assessed based on the fluency and relevance of the generated text, with BLEU scores serving as the primary evaluation metric. This task type is particularly suitable for testing the hypothesis as it requires precise and contextually appropriate text generation.\nPerformance Metrics: BLEU score is used as the primary metric for evaluating the quality of text completion outputs. It measures the overlap of n-grams between the generated text and reference texts, providing a quantitative measure of output quality. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing BLEU scores of text completions generated using P-Tuning and soft prompts, with higher scores indicating better performance.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to automate the experiment design and execution. The experiment will involve setting up GPT-2 with P-Tuning for text completion tasks. The process begins with integrating P-Tuning by adding trainable continuous prompt embeddings to the input sequence of GPT-2. This involves creating a new codeblock that optimizes these embeddings using gradient descent. The existing codeblock for GPT-2 will be used to handle the model's text generation capabilities. The text completion task will be defined by providing partial sentences as input, and the model will generate continuations. The generated text will then be evaluated using the BLEU score metric, which will be calculated by comparing the generated text against reference completions. The experiment will include a control setup using soft prompts for comparison. Data flow involves feeding input text to GPT-2 with P-Tuning, generating output text, and calculating BLEU scores. The implementation will require building a new codeblock for P-Tuning integration and using existing codeblocks for GPT-2 and BLEU score calculation. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is the BLEU score, which assesses the quality of text completion outputs by measuring the overlap of n-grams between generated and reference texts. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing BLEU scores of text completions generated using P-Tuning and soft prompts. A higher BLEU score for P-Tuning would indicate improved performance. The experiment will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical significance, with a focus on achieving consistent improvements in BLEU scores across different text completion scenarios. The control condition will involve using soft prompts with GPT-2, providing a baseline for comparison. Success will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in BLEU scores for P-Tuning compared to soft prompts.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing P-Tuning versus soft prompts for text completion tasks, using gpt-4o-mini as the base model. The experiment should be structured in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT), with the following specifications:\n\nPILOT MODES:\n- MINI_PILOT: Generate and evaluate 10 text completion examples, using training data\n- PILOT: Generate and evaluate 100 text completion examples, using 80 for training and 20 for evaluation (dev set)\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Generate and evaluate 1000 text completion examples, with 800 training, 100 dev, and 100 test examples\n\nEXPERIMENT STRUCTURE:\n1. Data Generation:\n   - Use the LLM to generate partial sentences (prompts) and their complete versions (ground truth)\n   - For each example, generate a partial sentence and 2-3 reference completions\n   - Store these in JSON format with fields: 'partial_text', 'reference_completions'\n\n2. Experimental Setup:\n   - Baseline Condition: Use soft prompts with gpt-4o-mini\n   - Experimental Condition: Use P-Tuning with gpt-4o-mini\n   - For each condition, generate completions for the partial sentences\n   - Calculate BLEU scores comparing generated completions against reference completions\n\n3. Implementation Details:\n   - Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n   - For soft prompts (baseline), use template: 'Complete this sentence naturally: {partial_text}'\n   - For P-Tuning (experimental), use continuous prompt embeddings with template: '[P1] [P2] [P3] {partial_text}' where [P1], [P2], [P3] are trainable embeddings\n   - Log all generated completions and BLEU scores\n\n4. Evaluation:\n   - Calculate BLEU scores for each completion against its reference completions\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to compare BLEU scores between conditions\n   - Report mean BLEU scores, standard deviations, and statistical significance\n\n5. Output Requirements:\n   - Generate a results file containing:\n     * All generated completions\n     * BLEU scores for each completion\n     * Summary statistics\n     * Bootstrap comparison results\n   - Generate a log file containing:\n     * All LLM calls and responses\n     * Any errors or warnings\n     * Timing information\n\nPlease run the MINI_PILOT first. If successful, proceed to PILOT. Stop after PILOT - do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT (this requires manual verification and approval).\n\nNote: This is a simplified version using gpt-4o-mini instead of GPT-2, focusing on comparing the two prompting approaches while maintaining the core experimental design. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1. A report, describing the results of your research. The report should include, among other things, the following parts: Title, Abstract, Introduction, Approach, Experiments, Results, Conclusion, References.\n 2.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Enhanced Audio-Visual Localization\nShort Description: Combining Space-Time Memory Network with Multi-window Temporal Transformer to improve audio-visual event localization precision.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating a Space-Time Memory Network with a Multi-window Temporal Transformer within a unified visual representation framework will enhance the precision of audio-visual event localization on the AVE dataset compared to using the Multi-window Temporal Transformer alone.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integration of a Space-Time Memory Network with a Multi-window Temporal Transformer\nDependent variable: Precision of audio-visual event localization\nComparison groups: Using the integrated framework vs. using the Multi-window Temporal Transformer alone\nBaseline/control: Using the Multi-window Temporal Transformer alone\nContext/setting: On the AVE dataset\nAssumptions: The integration will function as intended within the framework\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Audio-visual events in the AVE dataset\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Precision of localization\n\nLong Description: Description: This research investigates the impact of combining a Space-Time Memory Network with a Multi-window Temporal Transformer on the precision of audio-visual event localization using the AVE dataset. The Space-Time Memory Network leverages uni-modal and cross-modal representations by accumulating past evidence into memory, which is then propagated to the current timestep, enhancing temporal coherence and robustness against appearance and acoustic changes. The Multi-window Temporal Transformer operates on different temporal scales of video frames, capturing both short and long-range temporal interactions. By integrating these two mechanisms, we aim to improve the model's ability to localize audio-visual events more precisely. The hypothesis is that this combination will outperform the Multi-window Temporal Transformer alone by providing a more comprehensive temporal and cross-modal alignment, leading to higher precision in event localization. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods that struggle with temporal inconsistencies and ineffective multi-modal feature correspondence. \nKey Variables:\nSpace-Time Memory Network: The Space-Time Memory Network is designed to leverage both uni-modal and cross-modal representations by accumulating past evidence into memory, which is then aggregated and propagated onto the current timestep. It consists of audio and visual feature extraction, memory construction and propagation, and sounding object localization modules. This network is expected to improve temporal coherence and robustness against appearance and acoustic changes, directly influencing the precision of audio-visual event localization.\nMulti-window Temporal Transformer: The Multi-window Temporal Transformer operates on different temporal scales of video frames, allowing the model to capture both short and long-range temporal interactions. It enhances the ability to fuse audio and visual features effectively, crucial for grounding multi-modal feature correspondence and improving the precision of audio-visual event localization. This transformer is selected for its ability to handle varying temporal scales, making it relevant to the hypothesis.\nPrecision: Precision is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of a model by calculating the ratio of true positive results to the sum of true positive and false positive results. In this context, precision measures how many of the events identified by the model as audio-visual events were actually correct. It will be assessed by comparing the model's predictions against a ground truth dataset, such as the AVE dataset, and calculating the proportion of correctly identified events.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by integrating the Space-Time Memory Network with the Multi-window Temporal Transformer within a unified visual representation framework. The Space-Time Memory Network will be responsible for accumulating and propagating past evidence to enhance temporal coherence, while the Multi-window Temporal Transformer will operate on different temporal scales to capture both short and long-range interactions. The implementation will involve using existing codeblocks for the Multi-window Temporal Transformer and building a new module for the Space-Time Memory Network. Data will flow from the audio and visual feature extraction modules into the memory construction and propagation module of the Space-Time Memory Network, and then into the Multi-window Temporal Transformer. The final output will be evaluated using precision as the primary metric, comparing the integrated model's performance against a baseline model using only the Multi-window Temporal Transformer. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis is precision, which measures the ratio of true positive results to the sum of true positive and false positive results. The hypothesis will be tested using the AVE dataset, with the integrated model's precision compared to a baseline model using only the Multi-window Temporal Transformer. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher precision score for the integrated model, indicating more accurate localization of audio-visual events. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and qualitative evaluations will be derived from the precision scores.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to evaluate whether integrating a Space-Time Memory Network with a Multi-window Temporal Transformer improves audio-visual event localization precision. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot phases (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) defined by a global PILOT_MODE variable.\n\nExperimental Setup:\n1. Create two model variants:\n   - Baseline: Multi-window Temporal Transformer alone\n   - Experimental: Integrated Space-Time Memory Network with Multi-window Temporal Transformer\n\n2. Dataset Configuration (AVE dataset):\n   MINI_PILOT:\n   - Use 5 video clips from training set\n   - Maximum 10 temporal windows per clip\n   PILOT:\n   - Use 50 video clips from training set for training\n   - Use 25 video clips from validation set for evaluation\n   - Standard temporal window settings\n   FULL_EXPERIMENT:\n   - Full training set for training\n   - Full validation set for validation\n   - Full test set for final evaluation\n\n3. Implementation Details:\n   - Use Memory Agent framework to implement Space-Time Memory Network\n   - Memory should store and propagate both audio and visual features\n   - Memory update frequency: Every 5 frames\n   - Use gpt-4o-mini for any LLM components\n\n4. Evaluation Metrics:\n   - Primary: Precision (true positives / (true positives + false positives))\n   - Secondary: F1-score, Recall\n   - Plot learning curves showing precision over training iterations\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to compare baseline vs experimental results\n\n5. Logging Requirements:\n   - Log all hyperparameters\n   - Log precision scores for each video\n   - Log memory states at key points\n   - Log transformer attention patterns\n   - Create precision vs. recall plots\n\n6. Execution Flow:\n   a) Run MINI_PILOT first:\n      - Train both models on 5 clips\n      - Evaluate basic functionality\n      - Verify logging and metrics\n   b) If MINI_PILOT successful, run PILOT:\n      - Train on 50 clips\n      - Evaluate on 25 validation clips\n      - Perform statistical comparison\n   c) Stop after PILOT (await human verification before FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n\n7. Success Criteria:\n   MINI_PILOT:\n   - Both models run without errors\n   - All metrics compute successfully\n   - All logs generated properly\n   PILOT:\n   - Experimental model shows trend toward improved precision\n   - Statistical comparison shows promising direction\n   - Memory propagation working as expected\n\nPlease implement this experiment, ensuring all logs and results are clearly organized. The system should stop after the PILOT phase and await human verification before proceeding to FULL_EXPERIMENT. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

The hypothesis is that this integration will enable GPT-2 large, a model with approximately 774 million parameters, to achieve performance improvements on arithmetic tasks comparable to much larger models like GPT-3 6B. The Socratic CoT will be implemented using a problem decomposer and a subproblem solver to break down arithmetic problems into manageable subproblems. ESC will be employed to reduce computational costs by stopping sampling when consistent answers are reached within a window. The study will utilize synthetic unlabeled datasets generated by large language models to train GPT-2 large. This approach is expected to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities by leveraging the strengths of both Socratic CoT and ESC, addressing the challenges of computational efficiency and reasoning accuracy in smaller models. The research will contribute to understanding how advanced reasoning techniques can be adapted for smaller models, potentially reducing the reliance on large-scale models for complex reasoning tasks. \nKey Variables:\nModel Parameter Count: GPT-2 large, with approximately 774 million parameters, is selected for its potential to outperform larger models when equipped with advanced reasoning techniques. The model will be trained using a knowledge distillation approach, focusing on arithmetic reasoning tasks. The choice of GPT-2 large over alternatives like GPT-3 6B is due to its smaller size, which allows for more efficient computation while still achieving competitive performance. The model's effectiveness will be assessed by its ability to solve arithmetic tasks with accuracy improvements comparable to larger models.\nSocratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Implemented through a problem decomposer and subproblem solver, Socratic CoT will decompose arithmetic problems into subproblems, enabling GPT-2 large to tackle complex tasks by focusing on manageable components. This method is chosen for its demonstrated ability to enhance reasoning performance in smaller models, allowing them to achieve significant improvements compared to baselines. The effectiveness of Socratic CoT will be measured by the model's performance on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks.\nEarly-Stopping Self-Consistency: ESC will be used to reduce the computational cost of self-consistency by stopping sampling when consistent answers are reached within a window. This method is selected for its ability to maintain performance while reducing computational overhead, making it suitable for smaller models like GPT-2 large. The impact of ESC will be evaluated by comparing the model's performance and computational efficiency with and without ESC.\nUnlabeled Datasets: Synthetic unlabeled datasets generated by large language models will be used to train GPT-2 large. This approach leverages the generative capabilities of larger models to provide additional training data, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. The datasets will be evaluated based on their ability to improve the model's performance on arithmetic reasoning tasks.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the following components: GPT-2 large as the base model, Socratic Chain-of-Thought reasoning implemented through a problem decomposer and subproblem solver, and Early-Stopping Self-Consistency for efficient sampling. Synthetic unlabeled datasets will be generated using large language models, providing additional training data for GPT-2 large. The implementation will involve training GPT-2 large with Socratic CoT to decompose arithmetic problems into subproblems, which will be solved using the subproblem solver. ESC will be applied to reduce computational costs by stopping sampling when consistent answers are reached within a window. The model's performance will be evaluated on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks, comparing results with and without the integration of Socratic CoT and ESC. The expected outcome is that the combination of these techniques will enhance the model's reasoning capabilities, achieving performance improvements comparable to larger models while maintaining computational efficiency. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be arithmetic reasoning accuracy, measured on benchmarks such as GSM8K and SVAMP. The control condition will be the performance of GPT-2 large without the integration of Socratic CoT and ESC. Improvement will be interpreted as a significant increase in accuracy compared to the control condition, with a focus on achieving performance comparable to larger models like GPT-3 6B. Secondary metrics will include computational efficiency, measured by the reduction in sampling required with ESC, and the model's ability to generalize across different arithmetic tasks. Success will be determined by achieving accuracy improvements and computational efficiency gains, with statistical confidence assessed through multiple runs and comparisons with baseline models.\nResearch idea design: Please implement an experiment comparing arithmetic reasoning performance between a baseline and experimental condition using gpt-4o-mini.

Position Interpolation allows LLMs to handle extended sequences by adjusting position indices, thus maintaining coherence without retraining. Memory-Augmented Retrieval integrates external memory components into the retrieval process, enabling efficient access to relevant historical context. This combination is hypothesized to improve LLM performance by leveraging the strengths of both techniques: Position Interpolation's ability to extend context windows and Memory-Augmented Retrieval's capability to dynamically incorporate relevant information. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in tasks like question answering and summarization, where maintaining context and accessing relevant information are crucial. This research addresses gaps in existing studies by exploring a novel combination of techniques not extensively tested together, offering a promising direction for enhancing LLM capabilities in long-context scenarios. \nKey Variables:\nPosition Interpolation: Position Interpolation involves rescaling position indices to match the original window size, allowing the model to handle longer sequences without retraining. This technique is implemented by adjusting the positional encoding of the input tokens, effectively compressing the position indices to fit within the model's existing context window. Position Interpolation is particularly useful for extending the context window of pre-trained models, as it leverages the existing positional encodings while adapting to longer inputs. This method requires minimal fine-tuning and can be applied to various transformer-based architectures, making it a versatile tool for long-context tasks.\nMemory-Augmented Retrieval: Memory-Augmented Retrieval involves integrating external memory components into the retrieval process, allowing the model to access relevant information from past interactions. This approach is implemented by designing the model to include memory modules that can be dynamically updated and queried during inference, enabling efficient retrieval of historical context. Memory-Augmented Retrieval requires careful management of memory updates to ensure that the most relevant information is prioritized, enhancing the model's ability to process long sequences without the computational overhead of processing the entire input at once. This technique provides a flexible alternative to traditional retrieval methods, offering improved recall and integration of past information.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating Position Interpolation with Memory-Augmented Retrieval in a large language model. The implementation will involve the following steps: First, Position Interpolation will be applied to adjust the positional encodings of input tokens, allowing the model to handle longer sequences without retraining. This will be achieved by modifying the positional encoding matrix to compress position indices within the model's existing context window. Next, Memory-Augmented Retrieval will be integrated into the model's architecture, incorporating external memory components that store and retrieve past information during inference. This will involve designing memory modules that can be dynamically updated and queried, enabling efficient retrieval of historical context. The model will be evaluated on long-context tasks within the LongBench benchmark, such as question answering and summarization. The performance will be compared to a baseline model using static context windows and standard retrieval methods. The expected outcome is an improvement in task performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the combined techniques. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be task performance on the LongBench benchmark, specifically focusing on question answering and summarization tasks. Performance will be measured using standard metrics such as accuracy for question answering and ROUGE scores for summarization. A comparative setup will be used, with the proposed model's performance compared to a baseline model using static context windows and standard retrieval methods. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in task performance metrics. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, and qualitative evaluations will be derived from the coherence and relevance of the generated outputs.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing baseline vs position-interpolated memory retrieval on long-context tasks. The experiment should have three possible modes controlled by PILOT_MODE (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, or FULL_EXPERIMENT).\n\nCore Components:\n1. Use the Memory Agent architecture as a base, but modify it to include position interpolation (rescaling position indices to match original window size).\n2. Use gpt-4o-mini as the base model for all LLM calls.\n3.

FULL_EXPERIMENT (not to be run until pilot results verified):\n   - Full LongBench dataset\n   - All context lengths up to 8192 tokens\n   - Comprehensive evaluation metrics\n\nRequired Metrics (all phases):\n1.

XLM-R, a transformer-based model, is chosen for its robust cross-lingual capabilities, which are essential for handling multilingual legal texts in Switzerland. Dynamically learned event structures will be employed to allow the model to adapt to the nuances of legal events that are not consistently defined, enhancing its ability to extract relevant information from legal documents. MoCo contrastive learning will be used to improve the model's ability to differentiate between similar and dissimilar legal cases, thereby refining its predictive accuracy. The integration of these components is expected to create a synergistic effect, where the strengths of each technique complement the others, leading to a more precise and reliable legal judgment prediction model. This approach addresses gaps in existing research by focusing on the unique challenges of multilingual legal contexts and leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to improve model performance. \nKey Variables:\nXLM-R: XLM-R is a transformer-based model pretrained on a large corpus of multilingual text, including 100 languages. It is selected for its ability to handle multilingual tasks effectively, making it suitable for legal texts in English, French, and German. In this experiment, XLM-R will be fine-tuned on the Swiss-Judgment-Prediction dataset to enhance its performance in legal judgment prediction tasks. The model's cross-lingual capabilities are expected to improve the precision of predictions by allowing it to generalize better across different languages.\nDynamically Learned Event Structures: This approach involves using machine learning techniques to identify patterns and structures within legal texts that correspond to legal events. Unlike predefined schemas, dynamically learned event structures adapt to the nuances of different legal contexts, making them ideal for scenarios where legal events are not consistently defined. In this research, neural networks will be employed to learn these structures from the Swiss-Judgment-Prediction dataset, enhancing the model's ability to extract relevant information and improve prediction precision.\nMoCo Contrastive Learning: MoCo, or Momentum Contrast, is a contrastive learning framework that uses a dynamic dictionary with a queue and a moving-averaged encoder to maintain a large set of negative samples efficiently. It is chosen for its ability to improve the model's ability to differentiate between similar and dissimilar legal cases. In this experiment, MoCo will be applied to the legal text data to enhance the model's ability to capture the nuances of legal language, thereby improving prediction precision.\n\nImplementation: The implementation of this hypothesis will involve several key steps using the capabilities of the CodeScientist system. First, the XLM-R model will be fine-tuned on the Swiss-Judgment-Prediction dataset, utilizing its robust cross-lingual capabilities to handle multilingual legal texts. This will involve loading the pre-trained XLM-R model and adapting it to the specific nuances of the legal dataset through fine-tuning. Next, dynamically learned event structures will be implemented using neural networks to identify and extract relevant legal events from the dataset. This will require building a custom module to learn patterns and structures within the legal texts, allowing the model to adapt to the unique characteristics of Swiss legal cases. MoCo contrastive learning will be integrated into the framework to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between similar and dissimilar legal cases. This will involve setting up a dynamic dictionary with a queue and a moving-averaged encoder to maintain a large set of negative samples efficiently. The data flow between components will be managed through a series of integration layers, ensuring seamless interaction between the XLM-R model, dynamically learned event structures, and MoCo contrastive learning. The final implementation will be tested on the Swiss-Judgment-Prediction dataset, with the precision of legal judgment predictions as the primary evaluation metric. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be precision, which measures the number of true positive results divided by the sum of true positive and false positive results. This metric is particularly relevant in the context of legal judgment prediction, where the cost of false positives can be high. Precision will be calculated using standard evaluation libraries such as scikit-learn, providing a clear measure of how often the model correctly predicts legal judgments without falsely labeling incorrect outcomes as correct. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the precision of the integrated model against baseline models that do not incorporate dynamically learned event structures or MoCo contrastive learning. Success will be interpreted as a statistically significant improvement in precision over the baseline models, with multiple runs to ensure robustness.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing baseline and experimental approaches for multilingual legal judgment prediction.

The RegHNT model is designed to capture complex relationships among numerical values, table schema, and text information by using a relational graph modeling approach. This model will be combined with a Symbolic Reasoning Module, which is adept at performing complex numerical reasoning over hybrid data. The hypothesis posits that this integration will significantly enhance both the accuracy and efficiency of question answering on the TQA-Bench dataset, which is known for its challenging multi-table context. This research is motivated by the need to improve the reasoning capabilities of models dealing with complex data structures, as highlighted by existing literature. By leveraging the strengths of both the RegHNT model and the Symbolic Reasoning Module, the research seeks to address the limitations of current models in handling intricate relational data and performing advanced numerical reasoning. \nKey Variables:\nRelational Graph Enhanced Hybrid Model: The RegHNT model uses a relational graph to model the alignment between questions, tables, and paragraphs, capturing the relationships among numerical values, table schema, and text information. It frames the problem as an expression tree generation task, allowing for diverse numerical reasoning processes. This model is selected for its ability to effectively process and reason over complex data structures, which is crucial for handling the intricacies of multi-table question answering tasks.\nSymbolic Reasoning Module: The Symbolic Reasoning Module is designed to perform complex numerical reasoning over hybrid data. It operates on facts retrieved from both tables and text, applying symbolic reasoning techniques to derive answers. This module is crucial for handling the intricacies of multi-table contexts, providing a robust framework for evaluating the performance of models in handling complex numerical reasoning tasks. The module's ability to perform symbolic reasoning is expected to complement the relational graph modeling of the RegHNT model, enhancing the overall reasoning capabilities of the integrated system.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by integrating the RegHNT model with a Symbolic Reasoning Module. The RegHNT model will be used to capture the relationships among numerical values, table schema, and text information, using a relational graph modeling approach. This model will be paired with a Symbolic Reasoning Module, which will perform complex numerical reasoning over the hybrid data. The integration will be tested on the TQA-Bench dataset, which provides a challenging multi-table context for evaluating the performance of question answering models. The implementation will involve setting up the RegHNT model to process the input data, followed by the Symbolic Reasoning Module to perform reasoning tasks. The output from the Symbolic Reasoning Module will be evaluated against the benchmark dataset to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the integrated system. Existing codeblocks for relational graph modeling and symbolic reasoning will be adapted and integrated to create the complete system. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be accuracy and efficiency. Accuracy will be measured by the percentage of correctly answered questions on the TQA-Bench dataset, while efficiency will be assessed by the time taken to process and answer the questions. The control condition will be the performance of the RegHNT model and the Symbolic Reasoning Module when used independently. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in accuracy and a reduction in processing time compared to the control condition. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with results compared against existing baselines to validate the effectiveness of the integrated approach.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing a baseline RegHNT model against an experimental RegHNT+Symbolic model for multi-table question answering.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: mT5 and Zero-Shot Integration\nShort Description: Integrating mT5 with Zero-Shot Prompting to enhance cross-lingual verification accuracy.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating mT5 for multilingual machine translation with Zero-Shot Prompting with Self-Consistency will improve cross-lingual verification accuracy, as measured by F1-score, compared to using mT5 alone, when evaluated on the X-Fact dataset.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating mT5 with Zero-Shot Prompting with Self-Consistency\nDependent variable: Cross-lingual verification accuracy\nComparison groups: Using mT5 with Zero-Shot Prompting with Self-Consistency vs. using mT5 alone\nBaseline/control: Using mT5 alone\nContext/setting: Evaluated on the X-Fact dataset\nAssumptions: \nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: \nTimeframe: \nMeasurement method: F1-score\n\nLong Description: Description: This research aims to explore the integration of mT5, a multilingual machine translation model, with Zero-Shot Prompting with Self-Consistency for enhancing cross-lingual verification accuracy. The hypothesis posits that the combination of mT5's translation capabilities with the robust reasoning and consistency-checking abilities of Zero-Shot Prompting will lead to improved verification accuracy on the X-Fact dataset. mT5 will be used to translate claims and evidence into a common language, facilitating the processing of multilingual inputs. Zero-Shot Prompting with Self-Consistency will then be employed to generate multiple outputs for each claim and select the most consistent response, leveraging the model's inherent knowledge across languages. This approach is expected to outperform the use of mT5 alone by reducing translation errors and enhancing the model's ability to verify claims accurately across diverse linguistic contexts. The study addresses gaps in previous research by focusing on the synergy between translation and reasoning techniques, offering a novel approach to improving multilingual fact-checking. \nKey Variables:\nmT5: mT5 is a multilingual version of the T5 model, adapted for machine translation tasks. It operates in a sequence-to-sequence manner, translating input text from one language to another. The model is trained on a diverse set of languages, enabling it to perform well in multilingual contexts. In this research, mT5 will be used to translate claims and evidence into a common language, ensuring that the content is accurately represented for further processing. The choice of mT5 is based on its ability to handle multiple languages and its effectiveness in multilingual tasks, making it suitable for cross-lingual verification. The expected role of mT5 is to facilitate the translation of multilingual inputs, reducing language barriers and improving the accuracy of the fact-checking process.\nZero-Shot Prompting with Self-Consistency: Zero-Shot Prompting with Self-Consistency involves using a language model to generate responses without prior training on the specific task or language. This technique leverages the model's inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities to verify facts across different languages. In this research, Zero-Shot Prompting with Self-Consistency will be used to generate multiple outputs for each claim and select the most consistent response, enhancing the model's ability to verify claims accurately. The choice of this technique is based on its demonstrated effectiveness in improving cross-lingual fact-checking performance without additional training data. The expected role of Zero-Shot Prompting with Self-Consistency is to enhance the reasoning and consistency-checking capabilities of the model, leading to improved verification accuracy.\n\nImplementation: The implementation of this hypothesis will involve integrating mT5 for multilingual machine translation with Zero-Shot Prompting with Self-Consistency. The process begins with using mT5 to translate claims and evidence from the X-Fact dataset into a common language, ensuring that the content is accurately represented for further processing. This will involve setting up API calls to mT5 for real-time translation during the fact-checking process. Once the translation is complete, Zero-Shot Prompting with Self-Consistency will be employed to generate multiple outputs for each claim. This involves using a pre-trained language model to produce several responses and selecting the most consistent one across different runs. The integration of these components will be facilitated by a glue module that manages the data flow between mT5 and the Zero-Shot Prompting system. The expected outcome is an improvement in cross-lingual verification accuracy, as measured by the F1-score, compared to using mT5 alone. The implementation will be realized using Python, leveraging existing libraries for machine translation and natural language processing. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be the F1-score, which provides a balance between precision and recall. The F1-score will be calculated by taking the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both false positives and false negatives. The evaluation will be conducted on the X-Fact dataset, which includes multilingual claims and evidence. The control condition will be the use of mT5 alone for translation and verification, without the integration of Zero-Shot Prompting with Self-Consistency. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher F1-score for the integrated approach compared to the control condition. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with the expectation that the integrated approach will demonstrate superior performance in cross-lingual verification tasks.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment comparing mT5 alone versus mT5+Zero-Shot-Prompting for cross-lingual verification accuracy on the X-Fact dataset. The experiment should have three pilot modes (PILOT_MODE): MINI_PILOT, PILOT, and FULL_EXPERIMENT.\n\nDataset Setup:\n1. Use the Huggingface Datasets API to load the X-Fact dataset\n2. For MINI_PILOT, use 10 examples from the training set\n3. For PILOT, use 100 examples from the training set, and 50 from the validation set\n4. For FULL_EXPERIMENT, use the full dataset\n\nBaseline System (mT5 alone):\n1. Use the LLM API (with gpt-4o-mini) to simulate mT5 translation by having it translate the input text to English\n2. Have it make a verification decision (TRUE/FALSE) on the translated text\n3. Store the decision and ground truth for F1 calculation\n\nExperimental System (mT5 + Zero-Shot):\n1. First translate using simulated mT5 (as above)\n2. Then use Zero-Shot prompting with Self-Consistency:\n   - Generate 3 independent verifications using different prompts\n   - Take majority vote of the 3 responses\n3. Store the decision and ground truth for F1 calculation\n\nEvaluation:\n1. Calculate F1 scores for both systems\n2. Use bootstrap resampling to determine if the difference is significant\n3. Generate plots showing:\n   - F1 scores for both systems\n   - Bootstrap distribution of differences\n\nLogging Requirements:\n1. Log all LLM calls (prompts and responses)\n2. Log all translation outputs\n3. Log all verification decisions\n4. Log F1 scores and statistical test results\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. Generate a results.json file with:\n   - F1 scores for both systems\n   - Bootstrap test results\n   - Number of examples processed\n2. Generate plots saved as PDFs:\n   - F1 score comparison\n   - Bootstrap distribution\n\nPilot Process:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT (10 examples)\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT (150 examples)\n3. Stop after PILOT - do not proceed to FULL_EXPERIMENT\n4. Human verification required before FULL_EXPERIMENT\n\nPlease implement this experiment using the provided codeblocks, ensuring proper error handling and logging throughout. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Syntactic-Semantic Prompt Integration\nShort Description: Integrating syntactic complexity and semantic role labeling into soft prompts for enhanced interpretability and performance.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating syntactic complexity measures and semantic role labeling with attention mechanisms into soft prompt-based models will enhance interpretability, as measured by clarity and faithfulness scores, and improve performance in few-shot text classification tasks.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integration of syntactic complexity measures and semantic role labeling with attention mechanisms\nDependent variable: Interpretability and performance in few-shot text classification tasks\nComparison groups: Not explicitly mentioned\nBaseline/control: Not explicitly mentioned\nContext/setting: Soft prompt-based models\nAssumptions: The integration will lead to enhancements and improvements\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not explicitly mentioned\nTimeframe: Not explicitly mentioned\nMeasurement method: Clarity and faithfulness scores for interpretability\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of syntactic complexity measures and semantic role labeling with attention mechanisms into soft prompt-based models to enhance interpretability and performance in few-shot text classification tasks. Syntactic complexity measures, such as clauses per T-unit and mean T-unit length, provide insights into the structural complexity of text, which can be leveraged to improve the model's understanding of complex linguistic inputs. Semantic role labeling with attention mechanisms focuses on identifying and emphasizing the roles of words in sentences, enhancing the model's ability to capture semantic nuances. By incorporating these features into soft prompt-based models, which utilize the continuous embedding space for flexible prompt design, the study aims to improve the model's clarity and faithfulness in interpreting text. The expected outcome is an enhanced alignment with human-like understanding, leading to improved performance in few-shot learning scenarios. This approach addresses gaps in existing research by combining syntactic and semantic insights with advanced prompt engineering techniques, offering a novel method for improving model interpretability and task performance. \nKey Variables:\nSyntactic Complexity Measures: Syntactic complexity measures quantify the complexity of sentence structures using metrics such as clauses per T-unit and mean T-unit length. These measures are extracted using tools like L2SCA, which analyze the syntactic structure of sentences to provide a scalar measure of complexity. By incorporating these measures into soft prompt-based models, the model's ability to handle complex linguistic inputs is enhanced, improving its interpretability and alignment with human-like understanding. The expected role of this variable is to provide additional syntactic context, which aids in refining model predictions and enhancing clarity and faithfulness scores.\nSemantic Role Labeling with Attention Mechanisms: Semantic role labeling with attention mechanisms involves integrating attention layers into SRL models to enhance focus on relevant parts of the input text. This involves using models like BERT with additional attention layers that prioritize certain tokens based on their importance in determining semantic roles. The process includes training on SRL-specific datasets, where the attention mechanisms help in accurately identifying roles such as agent, patient, and instrument. This variable is expected to improve the model's ability to capture semantic nuances, thereby enhancing interpretability and performance in few-shot text classification tasks.\nSoft Prompt-based Models: Soft prompt-based models utilize the continuous embedding space of language models, allowing for the optimization of prompt parameters through training data from downstream tasks. Unlike hard prompts, soft prompts are not limited to human-interpretable language, offering greater flexibility in prompt design. This approach enhances model performance on few-shot learning tasks by leveraging additional prompt encoders' parameters. The expected role of this variable is to provide a flexible framework for integrating syntactic and semantic features, improving the model's interpretability and alignment with human-like understanding.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist's capabilities by integrating syntactic complexity measures and semantic role labeling with attention mechanisms into soft prompt-based models. The implementation will involve the following steps: 1) Extract syntactic complexity measures using the L2SCA tool, which will analyze the syntactic structure of input sentences and provide scalar measures of complexity. 2) Implement semantic role labeling with attention mechanisms using a pre-trained BERT model, fine-tuned on SRL-specific datasets to accurately identify semantic roles. Attention layers will be added to prioritize tokens based on their importance in determining semantic roles. 3) Develop soft prompt-based models by leveraging the continuous embedding space of language models. This will involve optimizing prompt parameters through training data from few-shot text classification tasks. 4) Integrate the extracted syntactic and semantic features into the soft prompt-based models, enhancing the model's interpretability and performance. The data flow will involve preprocessing input text to extract syntactic and semantic features, feeding these features into the soft prompt-based models, and evaluating the model's performance using clarity and faithfulness scores. The implementation will require building new modules for feature extraction and integration, while reusing existing codeblocks for soft prompt-based models and attention mechanisms. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be clarity and faithfulness scores, which assess the interpretability of the model's outputs. Clarity measures how clearly the model's features align with human-understandable concepts, while faithfulness assesses whether the feature descriptions accurately represent the causal role of those features in the model's decision-making process. Secondary metrics will include task success rate and reasoning accuracy in few-shot text classification tasks. The hypothesis will be tested using benchmark datasets for text classification, with a control condition involving a baseline model without the integrated syntactic and semantic features. Improvement will be interpreted as higher clarity and faithfulness scores, along with improved task success rate and reasoning accuracy compared to the baseline model. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence in the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment comparing baseline and experimental few-shot text classification systems. The experiment should have three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) with the following specifications:\n\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Use 10 training examples and 5 test examples from the 'imdb' dataset from Huggingface Hub\n- 3 runs with different random seeds for statistical comparison\n- Maximum 2 shots (examples) per classification task\n\nPILOT:\n- Use 100 training examples and 50 test examples\n- 5 runs with different random seeds\n- Maximum 3 shots per classification task\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n- Use 1000 training examples and 500 test examples\n- 10 runs with different random seeds\n- Maximum 5 shots per classification task\n\nBASELINE SYSTEM:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini as the base model\n- Standard few-shot prompt template: 'Here are some examples of movie review sentiment classification:\\n[EXAMPLES]\\n\\nPlease classify the following review as positive or negative:\\n[INPUT]'\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini as the base model\n- Extract syntactic complexity measures using NLTK:\n  * Number of sentences\n  * Average sentence length\n  * Average word length\n  * Lexical diversity (unique words / total words)\n- Extract semantic roles using NLTK's built-in semantic role labeler\n- Augment the prompt with this information: 'Here are some examples of movie review sentiment classification. For each example, I provide syntactic complexity measures and semantic role information to help with classification:\\n[EXAMPLES WITH FEATURES]\\n\\nFor the following review, here are its features:\\n[INPUT FEATURES]\\nPlease classify this review as positive or negative:'\n\nEVALUATION:\n1. Classification Performance:\n   - Accuracy\n   - F1 score\n   - Confusion matrix\n\n2. Interpretability Metrics:\n   - Clarity score: Ask gpt-4o-mini to rate (0-10) how clearly it can explain its classification decision\n   - Faithfulness score: Ask gpt-4o-mini to rate (0-10) how much it relied on the provided syntactic/semantic features\n\nThe experiment should:\n1. First run MINI_PILOT\n2. If successful, run PILOT\n3. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT (waiting for human verification)\n4. Use bootstrap resampling to compare baseline vs experimental results\n5. Generate line plots comparing performance across different pilot modes\n6. Log all prompts, responses, and scores\n\nPlease ensure proper error handling and logging throughout the experiment. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

    "problem_description": "You are an autonomous agent, tasked to perform the following research task:\nTASK DEFINITION:\n================\nName: Segmented Query Integration\nShort Description: Integrating segment-wise sampling with Q-Former to enhance video conversation quality and efficiency.\nHypothesis to explore: Integrating segment-wise sampling with Q-Former for query learning in Video-ChatGPT will enhance conversation coherence and relevance while reducing computational complexity and memory usage compared to using segment-wise sampling alone.\nKey Variables:\nIndependent variable: Integrating segment-wise sampling with Q-Former\nDependent variable: Conversation coherence, conversation relevance, computational complexity, memory usage\nComparison groups: Integration of segment-wise sampling with Q-Former vs. segment-wise sampling alone\nBaseline/control: Using segment-wise sampling alone\nContext/setting: Video-ChatGPT\nAssumptions: The integration will have the proposed effects\nRelationship type: Causation\nPopulation: Not specified\nTimeframe: Not specified\nMeasurement method: Not specified\n\nLong Description: Description: This research explores the integration of segment-wise sampling with Q-Former for query learning within the Video-ChatGPT framework. Segment-wise sampling allows for efficient video processing by dividing videos into manageable segments, capturing essential spatial and temporal details without overwhelming computational resources. Q-Former, on the other hand, focuses on learning a fixed number of queries to effectively capture essential features of video data, reducing the computational burden. By combining these two techniques, the research aims to enhance the coherence and relevance of video-based conversations while simultaneously reducing computational complexity and memory usage. The hypothesis posits that this integration will outperform segment-wise sampling alone by leveraging the strengths of both techniques. Segment-wise sampling ensures efficient data handling, while Q-Former optimizes feature extraction, leading to improved conversational quality. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing a more balanced and efficient processing pipeline, particularly beneficial in scenarios with limited computational resources. \nKey Variables:\nSegment-wise Sampling: Segment-wise sampling is a technique used to divide video data into segments, allowing the model to process only the most relevant parts of the video. This approach reduces computational complexity by focusing on key segments rather than the entire video. It is particularly useful in scenarios requiring real-time processing, as it enables the model to maintain high performance while operating within limited computational resources. In this research, segment-wise sampling will be implemented to manage video data efficiently, ensuring that only essential segments are processed, thereby reducing the computational load and memory usage.\nQ-Former for Query Learning: Q-Former is a technique used to learn a fixed number of queries by cross-attending to visual features. This method reduces computational complexity by limiting the number of queries that need to be processed. By focusing on a fixed set of queries, the model can efficiently manage computational resources required for video processing. In this research, Q-Former will be used to optimize feature extraction from video data, ensuring that only the most relevant features are captured, thereby enhancing the coherence and relevance of video-based conversations while reducing computational demands.\n\nImplementation: The implementation of the hypothesis will involve integrating segment-wise sampling and Q-Former within the Video-ChatGPT framework. The process begins with segment-wise sampling, where video data is divided into manageable segments based on criteria such as motion intensity or scene changes. This segmentation allows the model to focus on key parts of the video, reducing the computational load. Next, Q-Former is applied to learn a fixed number of queries from the segmented video data. This involves training a module to generate queries that effectively capture essential features, optimizing feature extraction and reducing computational complexity. The integration of these techniques will be facilitated by existing codeblocks for segment-wise sampling and Q-Former, with additional glue logic built to ensure seamless interaction between the components. Data will flow from the segment-wise sampling module to the Q-Former, where queries are generated and processed to enhance conversation quality. The hypothesis will be realized by evaluating the coherence and relevance of conversations generated by the integrated system, comparing it against a baseline using segment-wise sampling alone. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis will be coherence and relevance scores of the generated conversations. Coherence will be assessed by measuring the logical flow and consistency of dialogue, using automated metrics like BLEU or METEOR scores. Relevance will be evaluated by comparing the semantic content of the model's output with reference responses, using metrics like ROUGE scores. Computational complexity will be measured by tracking the number of operations and resource usage during processing, while memory usage will be assessed by monitoring the memory footprint of the model. Success will be interpreted as a significant improvement in coherence and relevance scores, along with a reduction in computational complexity and memory usage compared to the baseline.\nResearch idea design: Please create a pilot experiment to evaluate the integration of segment-wise sampling with Q-Former for video conversation. Due to the complexity of video processing, this pilot will use a simplified simulation where:\n\n1. Videos are represented as sequences of text descriptions (e.g. 'A person walking into frame from the left', 'The person waves at the camera', etc)\n2. Segment-wise sampling is simulated by grouping consecutive descriptions into segments\n3. Q-Former is simulated using gpt-4o-mini to generate fixed-length query representations\n\nPILOT MODE SETTINGS:\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Use 2 simulated videos, each with 10 text descriptions\n- Process 2 episodes per video\n- Maximum 10 steps per episode\n- Use training set only\n\nPILOT:\n- Use 10 simulated videos, each with 20 text descriptions\n- Process 5 episodes per video\n- Maximum 25 steps per episode\n- Use training set for training, dev set for evaluation\n\nFULL EXPERIMENT:\n- Use 100 simulated videos, each with 50 text descriptions\n- Process 20 episodes per video\n- Maximum 50 steps per episode\n- Use training/dev/test sets appropriately\n\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:\n\nBaseline System (Segment-wise sampling alone):\n1. Group consecutive text descriptions into segments of size 3\n2. For each segment, use gpt-4o-mini to generate a summary\n3. Use these summaries to answer questions about the video\n\nExperimental System (Segment-wise + Q-Former):\n1. Group consecutive text descriptions into segments of size 3\n2. For each segment, use gpt-4o-mini to generate a fixed set of 5 queries that capture key information\n3. Use these queries to guide the conversation\n\nMetrics to collect:\n1. Coherence: Use gpt-4o-mini to rate conversation coherence (0-10)\n2. Relevance: Use gpt-4o-mini to rate answer relevance to questions (0-10)\n3. Computational complexity: Track number of LLM calls\n4. Memory usage: Track maximum number of tokens in context\n\nFor each video:\n1. Generate 5 questions about the content\n2. Get responses using both baseline and experimental systems\n3. Evaluate using the metrics above\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Use bootstrap resampling to compare baseline vs experimental metrics\n2. Generate plots of the metrics\n3. Log all raw data, summaries, and statistical analyses\n\nRequired outputs:\n1. Detailed logs of all system operations\n2.

If successful, proceed to PILOT, then stop. The FULL EXPERIMENT setting will be manually enabled after human verification of the pilot results.\n\nNote: Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls as specified in the conditioning instructions. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

FactCC is a factual consistency evaluation method that uses natural language inference to ensure summaries align with source document facts. CaPE's parameter adjustment involves fine-tuning models on clean and noisy data subsets to create expert and anti-expert models, with parameter adjustments steering the base model towards factual accuracy. Gradient-based pruning uses loss function gradients to prune weights or neurons, maintaining model accuracy while reducing complexity. The hypothesis posits that combining these techniques will leverage FactCC's factual alignment, CaPE's parameter insights, and gradient-based pruning's efficiency to produce summaries with higher factual consistency and lower hallucination rates than when these techniques are used in isolation. This approach addresses gaps in existing literature by exploring a novel combination of techniques that individually tackle different aspects of the summarization challenge, aiming for a synergistic effect that enhances overall performance. \nKey Variables:\nFactCC Integration: FactCC uses natural language inference to evaluate factual consistency by predicting whether summary sentences are entailed by the source document. It is implemented by fine-tuning a BERT-based model on entailment-labeled sentence pairs. This method ensures that summaries are factually aligned with the source, reducing hallucinations. FactCC was chosen for its robust measure of factual consistency, providing a structured evaluation process that complements the other techniques.\nCaPE's Parameter Adjustment: CaPE's parameter adjustment involves creating expert and anti-expert models by fine-tuning on clean and noisy data subsets. The base model's parameters are adjusted based on differences between these models, steering it towards factual accuracy. This method enhances the model's ability to generate consistent summaries by leveraging insights from both high-quality and problematic data. It was selected for its ability to improve factual performance without degrading informativeness.\nGradient-based Pruning: Gradient-based pruning evaluates the sensitivity of the loss function to model parameters, pruning those with minimal impact. This technique maintains model accuracy while reducing complexity, making it suitable for enhancing model efficiency. It was chosen for its informed pruning decisions, which help maintain performance while simplifying the model. The expected role is to optimize model structure, supporting the other techniques in improving factual consistency.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented by first integrating FactCC into the summarization model to evaluate and enhance factual consistency. FactCC's BERT-based model will be used to assess entailment between summary sentences and the source document. Next, CaPE's parameter adjustment will be applied by fine-tuning the base model on clean and noisy data subsets to create expert and anti-expert models. The parameter differences will be used to adjust the base model, steering it towards factual accuracy. Finally, gradient-based pruning will be implemented to optimize the model's structure by pruning parameters with minimal impact on the loss function. This will involve calculating gradients during backpropagation and identifying parameters for pruning. The integration of these techniques will involve using existing codeblocks for FactCC and CaPE, while building a new module for gradient-based pruning. Data will flow from the source document through the summarization model, with FactCC evaluating factual consistency, CaPE adjusting parameters, and gradient-based pruning optimizing the model structure. The end-to-end implementation will involve setting up the summarization model, integrating FactCC for evaluation, applying CaPE's parameter adjustment, and implementing gradient-based pruning to achieve the desired outcomes. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be factual consistency, measured using FactCC's entailment accuracy. Secondary metrics include hallucination rate, assessed using the Precision-Source metric, and model efficiency, evaluated through computational cost and memory usage. The hypothesis will be tested using benchmark datasets like XSUM and CNN/DM, with a control condition involving the use of each technique in isolation. Improvement will be interpreted as higher factual consistency scores, reduced hallucination rates, and maintained or improved model efficiency. The evaluation will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical confidence, with success indicated by consistent improvements across metrics.\nResearch idea design: Please implement a pilot experiment to evaluate the integration of FactCC, CaPE, and gradient-based pruning for improving factual consistency in summarization.

TKGs store dynamic structured facts with timestamps, which are crucial for understanding event sequences. Temporal Contextualization involves grounding questions in specific temporal contexts by applying time ranges to events, thereby creating sub-questions that represent discrete reasoning steps. By combining these two approaches, the research aims to improve the model's ability to reason about event sequences and temporal contexts, which are essential for answering commonsense questions accurately. The hypothesis posits that this integration will lead to a significant improvement in accuracy compared to models that do not utilize both TKGs and Temporal Contextualization. The expected outcome is a model that can better handle time-sensitive information, leading to more accurate answers on the CommonsenseQA dataset. \nKey Variables:\nTemporal Knowledge Graphs: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) are used to store dynamic structured facts associated with timestamps, crucial for handling event ordering. They represent knowledge in the form of (subject, relation, object, timestamp) and are particularly useful for questions with temporal constraints. TKGs will be implemented by integrating large language models (LLMs) with temporal reasoning tasks, such as Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA). These models use TKGs to retrieve relevant subgraphs containing both structural and temporal information, enhancing the model's ability to reason about event sequences. The implementation involves training LLMs to understand and process these temporal constraints, which can be challenging due to the large search space involved.\nTemporal Contextualization: Temporal Contextualization involves grounding questions in specific temporal contexts by applying time ranges to events. This is achieved by selecting event edges and expanding nodes to create sub-questions that represent discrete reasoning steps within a multi-step inference process. The implementation uses a spatio-temporal graph-guided self-training approach, where each node expansion corresponds to a new sub-question and answer. This process builds a richer and more detailed chain-of-thought rationale, enabling the model to handle complex, multi-step questions with explicit temporal reasoning. The approach enhances the logical flow in the rationales and diversifies the types of questions and answers, making the model more adaptable to various temporal contexts.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the capabilities of CodeScientist, an end-to-end semi-automated scientific discovery system. The implementation will involve integrating Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) with Temporal Contextualization to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. The process begins by using existing codeblocks for TKGs to store dynamic structured facts with timestamps. These TKGs will be integrated with large language models (LLMs) to retrieve relevant subgraphs containing both structural and temporal information. The Temporal Contextualization component will be implemented using a spatio-temporal graph-guided self-training approach, where event edges are selected, and nodes are expanded to create sub-questions representing discrete reasoning steps. This approach will be built as a new module, requiring moderate effort. The data flow will involve retrieving temporal information from TKGs, applying temporal contextualization to ground questions in specific temporal contexts, and generating sub-questions for multi-step inference. The final output will be a model capable of handling complex, multi-step questions with explicit temporal reasoning, leading to improved accuracy on the CommonsenseQA dataset. \nMetrics to use: The primary metric for evaluating the hypothesis will be accuracy on the CommonsenseQA dataset. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the accuracy of the model with integrated TKGs and Temporal Contextualization against a baseline model without these components. The evaluation will involve measuring the model's ability to accurately answer commonsense questions that require temporal reasoning. Improvement will be interpreted as a higher accuracy rate compared to the baseline, with statistical confidence achieved through multiple runs. Secondary metrics may include precision and recall to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether integrating Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) with Temporal Contextualization improves commonsense QA accuracy. The experiment should have the following components:\n\n1. PILOT_MODE Settings:\n   - MINI_PILOT: Use 10 questions from CommonsenseQA training set\n   - PILOT: Use 200 questions from training set for development, 100 from validation set for evaluation\n   - FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use full dataset (but do not implement this mode yet)\n\n2. Dataset:\n   - Load CommonsenseQA dataset from Huggingface Hub\n   - Filter for questions that have temporal aspects (e.g., contain words like 'before', 'after', 'during', 'when', etc.)\n\n3. Implementation:\n   Create two conditions:\n   a) Baseline condition:\n      - Direct QA using gpt-4o-mini\n      - Simple prompt template: 'Question: {question}\\nChoices:\\n{choices}\\nAnswer:'\n   b) Experimental condition (TKG+TC):\n      - Step 1: Create temporal knowledge graph\n        - Extract temporal entities and relations from question using gpt-4o-mini\n        - Store as DOT graph with timestamps\n        - Highlight temporal relationships\n      - Step 2: Temporal contextualization\n        - Break question into temporal sub-questions\n        - Answer sub-questions using TKG\n        - Combine sub-answers for final answer\n\n4. Evaluation:\n   - Primary metric: Accuracy (correct answers / total questions)\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to compare conditions\n   - Log full trajectories including:\n     * Original question\n     * Generated TKG (as DOT and PDF)\n     * Temporal sub-questions and their answers\n     * Final answer\n     * Whether answer was correct\n\n5. Output:\n   - Summary statistics for each condition\n   - Bootstrap comparison results\n   - Visualizations of TKGs\n   - Full logs of all steps\n\nPlease implement the MINI_PILOT first. If successful, proceed to PILOT, then stop (do not proceed to FULL_EXPERIMENT). All LLM calls should use gpt-4o-mini through the proxy server. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

MEMIT focuses on updating factual knowledge by precisely locating and editing specific parameters, ensuring that the model remains accurate without affecting unrelated knowledge. ConceptEdit enhances commonsense reasoning by dynamically diagnosing and augmenting implausible knowledge with conceptual understanding. By combining these approaches, the study aims to create a more robust editing framework that addresses both factual and commonsense knowledge gaps, leading to outputs that are both fluent and coherent. This integration is expected to outperform individual applications of MEMIT and ConceptEdit, as it leverages the strengths of both methods to address the limitations of each. The research will evaluate the effectiveness of this integrated approach using fluency and coherence metrics, providing insights into its potential to enhance language model performance in real-world applications. \nKey Variables:\nMEMIT for Factual Knowledge Editing: MEMIT is a method designed to locate and edit specific factual knowledge within large language models. It operates by identifying the parameters associated with outdated or incorrect knowledge and updating them to reflect new information. This approach is particularly effective for batch editing, where multiple pieces of knowledge need to be updated simultaneously. MEMIT ensures precise edits without affecting unrelated knowledge, maintaining the model's overall performance. Its role in this research is to provide accurate and reliable factual updates, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the model's knowledge base.\nConceptEdit for Commonsense Knowledge Editing: ConceptEdit enhances the commonsense reasoning capabilities of LLMs by integrating conceptualization and instantiation into the knowledge editing pipeline. This framework dynamically diagnoses implausible commonsense knowledge using a verifier LLM and augments the source knowledge with conceptual understanding for better generalizability. ConceptEdit ensures that the model can generate plausible commonsense knowledge, improving performance across multiple question-answering benchmarks. Its role in this research is to enhance the model's ability to handle commonsense reasoning tasks, ensuring that the outputs are both plausible and consistent.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using CodeScientist's capabilities to integrate MEMIT and ConceptEdit within a unified editing framework. The existing codeblock for MEMIT will be utilized to perform factual knowledge edits by identifying and updating specific parameters associated with outdated knowledge. Concurrently, ConceptEdit will be implemented to enhance commonsense reasoning by dynamically diagnosing and augmenting implausible knowledge. The integration will involve a glue module that coordinates the application of MEMIT and ConceptEdit, ensuring that factual and commonsense edits are applied in a complementary manner. Data will flow from the input layer through MEMIT for factual updates, then through ConceptEdit for commonsense enhancements, and finally to the output layer for evaluation. The implementation will include setting up the necessary configurations for each method, defining the input-output mappings, and ensuring that the integrated framework operates seamlessly. The hypothesis will be realized by running experiments on benchmark datasets, measuring the fluency and coherence of the outputs, and comparing the results against baseline models using only MEMIT or ConceptEdit. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are fluency and coherence metrics, which assess the naturalness and logical flow of generated text. Fluency will be measured by the model's ability to generate text that is grammatically correct and easy to read, while coherence will evaluate the logical consistency and relevance of the content. The hypothesis will be tested using benchmark tasks such as question answering and commonsense reasoning, with a control condition involving baseline models using only MEMIT or ConceptEdit. Improvement will be interpreted as a statistically significant increase in fluency and coherence scores compared to the baselines, with multiple runs conducted to ensure reliability and robustness of the results.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether integrating MEMIT and ConceptEdit improves language model output consistency and reliability. The experiment should be implemented in three pilot phases (controlled by PILOT_MODE), with the following specifications:\n\nPILOT PHASES:\n- MINI_PILOT: Use 10 knowledge editing examples (5 factual, 5 commonsense) from training set, with 3 evaluation prompts per edited example\n- PILOT: Use 100 knowledge editing examples (50 factual, 50 commonsense) from training set, with 5 evaluation prompts per edited example\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use 1000 knowledge editing examples (500 factual, 500 commonsense), with 10 evaluation prompts per edited example\n\nCONDITIONS TO TEST:\n1. Baseline 1: MEMIT only (for factual knowledge editing)\n2. Baseline 2: ConceptEdit only (for commonsense knowledge editing)\n3. Experimental: Integrated MEMIT+ConceptEdit\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STEPS:\n1. Initialize gpt-4o-mini as the base model for all conditions\n2. For each knowledge editing example:\n   - For MEMIT: Format as factual edit prompt\n   - For ConceptEdit: Format as commonsense reasoning prompt\n   - For Integrated: Apply MEMIT first, then ConceptEdit\n3. For each edited example, generate responses to evaluation prompts\n4. Evaluate responses using fluency and coherence metrics:\n   - Use gpt-4o-mini to rate fluency (1-5 scale)\n   - Use gpt-4o-mini to rate coherence (1-5 scale)\n   - Average the scores\n\nEVALUATION:\n1. For each condition, calculate:\n   - Mean fluency score\n   - Mean coherence score\n   - Combined score (average of fluency and coherence)\n2. Compare conditions using bootstrap resampling:\n   - Integrated vs MEMIT only\n   - Integrated vs ConceptEdit only\n\nOUTPUT:\n1. Log file containing:\n   - All prompts and responses\n   - Individual fluency/coherence scores\n   - Error cases and exceptions\n2. Results file containing:\n   - Summary statistics for each condition\n   - Bootstrap comparison results\n   - Recommendations for proceeding to next phase\n\nPROCESS:\n1. Run MINI_PILOT first\n2. If successful, run PILOT\n3. Stop after PILOT for human verification\n4. (FULL_EXPERIMENT requires manual activation)\n\nPlease implement appropriate error handling and logging throughout. All LLM calls should use gpt-4o-mini through the proxy server. Use bootstrap resampling with 1000 resamples for statistical comparisons. \n\n------ end of task definition -----\nNOW: Please perform this task and produce four results:\n 1.

Hierarchical clustering is used to group tasks that share semantic similarities, which are quantified using cosine similarity. The hypothesis posits that this method will improve the task-specific accuracy and sample efficiency of BERT models compared to a baseline of random task selection. The hierarchical clustering approach is chosen for its ability to uncover nested task structures, which can be particularly beneficial in organizing tasks that exhibit varying degrees of similarity. Cosine similarity is employed as it effectively measures semantic similarity in high-dimensional spaces, making it suitable for evaluating task embeddings derived from language models. By clustering tasks before pre-finetuning, the model is expected to learn more generalized representations, leading to improved performance on unseen tasks and reduced data requirements during fine-tuning. This approach addresses gaps in existing literature by focusing on the combination of hierarchical clustering and cosine similarity, which has not been extensively explored in the context of pre-finetuning language models. \nKey Variables:\nHierarchical Clustering: Hierarchical clustering is a method that organizes tasks into a tree-like structure, revealing nested similarities among tasks. In this research, it is implemented using an agglomerative approach, where each task starts as its own cluster, and clusters are merged based on their cosine similarity. This method is chosen for its ability to provide a detailed view of task relationships, which can be leveraged to enhance the learning process during pre-finetuning. The expected outcome is that tasks grouped in this manner will allow the model to learn shared representations more effectively, improving task-specific accuracy and sample efficiency.\nCosine Similarity: Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a metric for semantic similarity. In this study, it is used to evaluate the similarity between task embeddings, which are derived from a pre-trained BERT model. The choice of cosine similarity is based on its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces, where it can accurately capture semantic relationships. The metric is expected to facilitate the formation of meaningful task clusters, which in turn will enhance the model's ability to generalize across tasks.\nTask-specific Accuracy: Task-specific accuracy is the primary metric for evaluating the model's performance on individual tasks. It is measured by comparing the model's predictions to a labeled dataset specific to each task. Improvements in this metric will indicate that the hierarchical clustering approach has successfully enhanced the model's ability to generalize to specific tasks.\nSample Efficiency: Sample efficiency is defined as the number of examples needed to reach a performance threshold during fine-tuning. This variable is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the pre-finetuning stage in reducing data requirements. The hypothesis predicts that hierarchical clustering will improve sample efficiency by enabling the model to learn more generalized representations during pre-finetuning.\n\nImplementation: The hypothesis will be implemented using the CodeScientist system, which will automate the experiment setup and execution. The process begins with extracting task embeddings from a pre-trained BERT model. These embeddings are then used to compute cosine similarity between tasks. Hierarchical clustering is performed using an agglomerative approach, where tasks are iteratively merged based on their similarity scores. The resulting clusters are used to organize tasks during the pre-finetuning stage. The pre-finetuning involves training the BERT model on these clustered tasks, allowing it to learn shared representations. The model is then fine-tuned on individual tasks to evaluate task-specific accuracy and sample efficiency. The implementation requires existing codeblocks for BERT model loading, cosine similarity computation, and hierarchical clustering. New codeblocks will be developed to integrate these components and manage the data flow between them. The experiment will be conducted in a controlled environment, with random task selection serving as the baseline for comparison. \nMetrics to use: The primary metrics for evaluating the hypothesis are task-specific accuracy and sample efficiency. Task-specific accuracy is measured by the percentage of correct predictions on a labeled dataset specific to each task. Sample efficiency is assessed by the number of examples required to reach a predefined performance threshold during fine-tuning. The hypothesis will be tested using benchmark datasets such as GLUE or SuperGLUE. The control condition involves random task selection during pre-finetuning, providing a baseline for comparison. Success will be interpreted as a statistically significant improvement in both metrics compared to the baseline. Multiple runs will be conducted to ensure the reliability of the results, and statistical tests will be applied to confirm the significance of the findings.\nResearch idea design: Please create an experiment to test whether hierarchical clustering of tasks using cosine similarity during pre-finetuning enhances task-specific accuracy and sample efficiency of language models.
