YOUR NEXT INSTRUCTION: Generate a partial plan - one or more initial steps - to get started on this task.
The partial plan should specify initial explorations / data gathering operations to help you get started.
As the full plan will depend on the results from those initial steps, you don't (and can't) generate the full plan right now.

The last step of your partial plan should be exactly "Plan what to do next".
I'll then execute the partial plan. When we reach that last step, we'll decide from there what should follow!

You can reuse variables and data structures from the earlier execution, if that is helpful.
I will then discard the old plan, and continue with your revised plan.
Make sure your plan is DIFFERENT to the previous PLAN!! In particular, DO NOT REPEAT THE STEP THAT FAILED!

## **OLD** VERSION LATER
REFLECTION_SUBPROMPT = """
YOUR NEXT INSTRUCTION: Perform a REFLECTION step to assess if top-level task is complete, the current plan step is complete, if shortcuts were taken, etc.

Assess:
- thought: Summarize the progress made so far in the research, and what to do next
- task_complete: Have you achieved the top-level research task?
- current_step_complete: Have you successfully completed the current step in the plan? If you generated data or results, did you remember to print out the results so they are visible in the conversation history for future steps?
- software_bug: Did a Python error message occur when executing the code?
- took_shortcuts: Did you take a shortcut to completing the step, so the execution wasn't completely faithful? For example
     - You simulated an external database, system, or human, rather than actually using that resource (because it wasn't available)
     - You generated code containing stubs, rather than generating a completely operational piece of code
     - You guessed or approximated the result of a function, rather than actually executing it
     - You used some imagined or hypothetical values, rather than actual values derived from data
   Note: if the current step is incomplete, this does not automatically mean you took a shortcut - it just means you still have 
   some extra work to do on the current step.

And then: Tell me what the next TYPE of action should be (not the action itself). It should be one of:
 - "done": if the overall task is complete. This ends the experimental run.
 - "next_step": if the current step is complete. This moves us to work on the next step in the plan.
 - "continue": if the current step made progress, but something was missed or the code did not do the right thing. This moves us to take additional actions to complete the step.
 - "debug": if a Python error message appeared. This will cause us to debug and retry the step.
 - "abort_shortcuts": if shortcuts were taken. This causes the plan to be abandoned. It's important to abandon a plan if a shortcut was taken.
 - "abort_impossible": if the plan appears logically impossible to succeed.
 - "replan": if the current plan doesn't seem to be going anywhere. This will trigger abandoning the current plan and replanning from the current state.
 - {"action":"retry_earlier_step", "step_number":NUMBER, "revised_instructions":INSTRUCTIONS}
   This complex action tells us to redo an earlier plan setp (NUMBER), with revised instructions.
   This action is done if current evidence suggests a problem with an earlier step.
   The revised instructions should guide the system to (re)perform the earlier step in a way that avoids that problem.
   For example, if a generated dataset is too hard or too easy, we might go back and regenerate it with extra instructions about the appropriate difficulty level.

  {"thought": STRING, "task_complete": BOOLEAN, "current_step_complete": BOOLEAN, "software_bug": BOOLEAN, "took_shortcuts": BOOLEAN, "next_action":NEXT_ACTION}
