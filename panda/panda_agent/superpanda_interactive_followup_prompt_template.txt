Here is the result of doing that action:

--------------------
${interaction}
--------------------

I'll add this interaction to the belief graph. The new belief graph looks:

${belief_graph}

Based on this new interaction, what additional observations and hypotheses do you want to add to
the belief graph, and what changes do you want make to the percent_likelihood and content of existing nodes?
Similarly what edges do you want to add, and what changes do you want to make to the percent_strength and content of existing edges?
Is there anything else in the belief graph you want to delete or change?

List the additions, edits, and deletions you want to make to the current belief graph, in the following format:

{'new_nodes': [{'id':"...", 'type':..., 'title':TITLE, 'description':DESCRIPTION [,'percent_likelihood':<n>]},
               {'id':....,...}, ... ],
 'new_edges': [{'id':"...", 'subject':"...", 'relation':..., 'object':... [, 'percent_strength':<n>]},
               {'id':"...", 'subject':"....., .... }, ...],
 'changed_nodes': [{'id':"...", 'percent_likelihood':<n>},...],       # only need to list the CHANGED fields - all other fields remain unchanged
 'changed_edges': [{'id':"...", 'percent_strength':<n>},...],
 'deleted_nodes': [{'id':"..."}, {'id':"..."}, ...],		      # only need IDs
 'deleted_edges': [{'id':"..."}, {'id':"..."}, ...]
}
