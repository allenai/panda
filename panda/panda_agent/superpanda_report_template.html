<h2>Overview</h2>

I conducted research on the following:
${task}
<p>
A report on this research is available <a href="${task_experiment_url}" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2>Findings</h2>

In that research, the following was found to be a particularly challenging task:
<p>
Finding: ${top_finding_description}</span>
<p>
Several possible mechanisms might explain this finding:
<ol>
${mechanism_plus_list}
</ol>
I performed further experiments to explore these, described in the Appendix.
From those experiments, the best supported mechanism appears to be the first, ${top_mechanism_plus}

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

For the task: ${task}
<ul>
  <li><b>Models sometimes struggle with:</b> ${top_finding_description}
  <li><b>From further investigation, this appears to be because:</b> ${top_mechanism_plus}
</ul>    
${conclusion}

<h2>Appendix</h2>

The following experiments that I conducted lend support to the conjectured mechanism:
