You are a researcher, tasked with solving a quest described below. First I'll describe the scenario,
then you can suggest an action take, then I'll tell you the result of that interaction, then you can
suggest a new action to take, etc.

Throughout, you'll use a BELIEF GRAPH to keep track of each interaction, the observations
you make that are contained in those interactions, and the hypotheses you come up with
that those observations support. After each action you suggest, I'll tell you the result of
that interaction and ask you to update your belief graph accordingly.

Here is the specification of the belief graph representation:

======================================================================
Specification of the belief graph representation:
======================================================================

There are three types of nodes:

1. Hypotheses (named H*): conjectures about the world, e.g.,:
     {'id':"H1", 'type':"hypothesis", 'title':"food contamination", 'description':"Food contamination by pathogenic microorganisms", 'percent_likelihood':30}
     {'id':"H2", 'type':"hypothesis", 'title':"bad pizza", 'description':"There some problem with the colonists' pizza", 'percent_likelihood':10}
   Note that, unlike other nodes, this one has an extra feature namely percent_likelihood (degree of confidence the hypothesis is true).
     
2. Interactions (named I*): actions you performed and the environment's response, e.g.,
     {'id':"I1", 'type':"interaction", 'title': "interview", 'description':"You interview Adams. He says he exercised, ate cafeteria pizza, and now feels ill."}
     
3. Observations (named O*): A specific observation contained in the overall environment's response (I*) to an action, e.g.,
     {'id':"O1", 'type':"observation", 'title':"ill after eating pizza", 'description':"Adams ate pizza, and now feels ill"}

There are four types of edges:

1. Interactions include observations, e.g., using the above nodes:
   {'id':"E1", 'subject':"I1", 'relation':"includes", 'object':"O1"}           # I1 (the interview) includes the observation O1 (Adams became ill after pizza)

2. Observations supports Hypotheses, e.g.,
   {'id':"E2", 'subject':"O1", 'relation':"supports", 'object':"H2", 'percent_strength':70}	# O1 (Adams became ill after pizza) supports H2 (bad pizza)
   Note that this relation has an extra feature namely percent_strength (degree of support).

3. Observations contradicts Hypotheses, e.g.,
   {'id':"E3", 'subject':"O1", 'relation':"contradicts", 'object':"H3", 'percent_strength':20}	# O1 (Adams became ill after pizza) contradicts H3 (radiation sickness)
   Note that this relation has an extra feature namely percent_strength (degree of weakening).

4. One hypothesis is a specialization (special case, sub-hypothesis) of another, e.g.,
   {'id':"E4", 'subject':"H2", 'relation':"is specialization of", 'object':"H1"}			# H2 (bad pizza) is specialization of H1 (food contamination)

======================================================================

The initial belief graph is empty, and looks like this:

{'nodes':[], 'edges':[]}

--------------------

Let's get started!

Here is the initial "interaction", namely the initial scenario including a description of your quest:

--------------------
${interaction}
--------------------

I'll add this "interaction" to the belief graph. The new belief graph looks:

${belief_graph}

Based on this new interaction, what observations and hypotheses do you want to add to the belief graph?
Return you answer in the following JSON form:

{'new_nodes': [{'id':"...", 'type':..., 'title':TITLE, 'description':DESCRIPTION [,'percent_likelihood':<n>]},
               {'id':....,...}, ... ],
 'new_edges': [{'id':"...", 'subject':"...", 'relation':..., 'object':... [, 'percent_strength':<n>]},
               {'id':"...", 'subject':"....., .... }, ...] }

Go ahead!
