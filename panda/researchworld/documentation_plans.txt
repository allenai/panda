Top-level Task: How good is OLMo at addition?
======================================================================
step 1: Ideate three or four *types* of addition problems, to explore where OLMo is string, and where it might be weak..
step 2: For each addition type, generate 10 questions to test OLMo on problems of that type
step 3: Have OLMo answer all the questions
step 4: Score the answers
step 5: Compute the average scores for each addition type, and put the results in a new Dataframe table
step 6: Articulate some conclusions about which types were easier or harder
step 7: Write a report

======================================================================
Top-level Task: How well can OLMo translate into different languages?
======================================================================
step 1. Identify some languages to test OLMo on
step 2: Generate a dataset of sentences for testing OLMo's translation capabilities
step 3: For each language, have OLMo translate the source sentence into that language
step 4: For each language, score OLMo's translations    
step 5: Compute OLMo's average translation score for each language
step 6: Data for report: Print the scores showing how well OLMo can translate to the different languages
step 7: Data for report: Find an example of success and failure for each language
step 8. Write a report on the research

======================================================================
Top-level Task: Is Olmo or Llama better at telling jokes?
======================================================================
step 1: Generate a dataset of prompts for jokes, e.g., 'Tell me a joke about an interviewee completely misunderstanding the job description.'
step 2: Have the two different models, olmo and llama, create jokes for each prompt
step 3: Score the jokes, according to how funny they are    
step 4: Compute the average funniness of each model    
step 5: Data for report: Print out the average funniness of each model    
step 6: Data for report: Print out a good and bad example, for each model
step 7. Write a report on the research

======================================================================
Top-level Task: How well correlated are OLMo's and Llama's abilities at math?
======================================================================
step 1: Generate a dataset of math problems, with a range of diffulty
step 2: Have the two language models, olmo and llama, answer the questions
step 3: Score the models' answers using LM-as-judge    
step 4: See how well correlated the scores are, using the Spearman rank correlation
step 5: Intepret the result
step 7. Write a report on the research

======================================================================
Top-level Task: How well can OLMo generate stories? Assess each story on fluency, creativity, and interestingness. What types of story is OLMo best at, in each of those dimensions?
======================================================================
step 1: Generate a dataset of story prompts, e.g., 'Write a story about a cat who lost his tail.'
step 2: Have OLMo generate stories for each prompt
step 3: Score OLMo's stories along three dimensions: fluency, creativity, and interestingness
step 4: Ideate what types of story prompt resulted in the best OLMo stories. Do this for each dimension.
step 5. Write a report on the research

======================================================================
Top-level Task: Characterize OLMo's knowledge about World War II
======================================================================
step 1: Ideate three or four *types* of knowledge about World War II, to explore where OLMo is strong, and where it might be weak.
step 2: For each knowledge type, generate 10 questions to test that knowledge
step 3: Have OLMo answer all the questions
step 4: Score the answers
step 5: Compute the average scores for each knowledge type, and put the results in a new Dataframe table
step 6: Articulate some conclusions about which types were easier or harder
step 7: Write a report

======================================================================
Top-level Task: Generate a literature review about the topic: To what extent do LLMs have a Theory of Mind?
======================================================================
step 1. Find papers about the extent to which LLMs have a Theory of Mind
step 2. Collect summaries of those papers
step 3: Identify the main themes in those summaries
step 4: For each theme, generate a paragraph summarizing whe paper summaries say about it
step 5: Collect those thematic paragraphs into a final report
